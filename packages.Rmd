## Quick start

In my first package, I just put some functions I used again and again in my work.

To quickly start your package, just follow these steps:

1. Create an RStudio project (not a package). Here I advise you to create a new project in GitHub and then to clone it as an RStudio project. It is a good practice to put all your (public) stuff on GitHub (as we learned in section \@ref(git))

1. Run the following lines of R code.

```{r}
usethis::use_description()
usethis::use_namespace()
usethis::use_package_doc()
usethis::use_roxygen_md()
```
