## RStudio Features

- everything you can expect from a good IDE

- keyboard shortcuts I use
  1. *Crtl + Space* (autocompletion)
  2. *Ctrl + Up* (command history & search)
  3. *Ctrl + Click* (function source code)
  3. *Ctrl + Enter* (execute line of code)
  4. *Ctrl + Shift + K* (knit)
  4. *Ctrl + Shift + B* (build package or website)
  4. *Ctrl + Shift + M* (pipe)
  4. *Alt + Shift + K* to see all shortcuts
  4. ...

- Panels (everything is integrated, including **Git**)

- **R Projects**

## R Projects

- **Meaningful structure** in one folder

- The working directory automatically switches to the project's folder.

- File tab displays the associated files and folders in the project

- History of R commands and open files.

- Any settings associated with the project, such as Git settings, are loaded.

- Note that a *set-up.R* or even a *.Rprofile* file in the project's root directory enable project-specific settings to be loaded each time people work on the project.

# Version control (Git)

## tracks changes to your code

---

## You don't use version control?

```

## Why should you use version control?

Have you ever:

- **Made a change to code, realised it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?**
- **Lost code or had a backup that was too old?**
- Had to maintain multiple versions of a product?
- Wanted to see the difference between two (or more) versions of your code?
- Wanted to prove that a particular change broke or fixed a piece of code?
- Wanted to review the history of some code?
- **Wanted to submit a change to someone else's code?**
- **Wanted to share your code, or let other people work on your code?**
- Wanted to see how much work is being done, and where, when and by whom?
- Wanted to experiment with a new feature without interfering with working code?

In these cases, and no doubt others, a version control system should make your life easier.

## Why should you use version control?

### Working with GitHub, a line on your CV

<br>

> A lot of students have said to me later, even first-year undergraduates, that using GitHub has helped them a lot when they went for an internship or a research position interview.

> They are able to say, "Oh, I already have worked with GitHub. I'm familiar with it. I know how it works.” So I think they are at least able to put that on their CVs and go into a situation where there's a research or data analysis team and say, "Yeah, sure. I am actually familiar with the same tools that you use."

### February session: Best coding practices

A. Arnaud & J. Arbel will focus on

- coding style

- R packages (RStudio & Git are super useful for developing!!)

<br>

### June session: Make your personal webpage with R

We will focus on using R Markdown & GitHub in order to easily make websites, presentations & reports, and make them available online.

## Git platforms (share your code, collaborate)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/magrichard), [documentation](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) (only free for public repositories)

- [GitLab UGA](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), [documentation](https://docs.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/help/) or just [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) (open source & free)

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (free with less than 5 collaborators)

- any server..

## 3 main commands: commit, push, and pull

- pull: update your local project with the latest version of the main project

- commit: snapshot of your code at a specified point in time

- push: merge your local modifications with the main project

# Demo: RStudio & GitHub

## [Also, video from Nicholas Reich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZ8J2rqhEM)

---

## Create a local Git repository

1 - RStudio > New Project > New directory > R packages + create a git repository

2 - Go to the git menu, on the top-right, and add your files of interest: 

- (i) save your changes, 

- (ii) open the commit window, 

- (iii) select files, 

- (iv) stage files, 

- (v) write a commit message, 

- (vi) commit

---

## Create a local Git repository 

1 - RStudio > New Project > New directory > R packages + create a git repository

2 - Go to the git menu, on the top-right, and add your files of interest: 

3 - Synchronising with GitHub. Go to RStudio > Tools > Shell

- create a new repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and give it the same name as your package

- push your local respository from the command line

`git remote add origin https://github.com/magrichard/testgit.git`

`git push -u origin master`

4 - Check that your GitHub repository is updated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/magrichard/testgit)

---

## Publishing your code on GitHub (or Gitlab...)


1 - Change something (modify the hello.R file and create a new R file)

2 - Go to the git menu, on the top-right, and add your files of interest: 

- (i) save your changes, 

- (ii) open the commit window, 

- (iii) select files, 

- (iv) stage files, 

- (v) write a commit message, 

- (vi) commit

- **(vii) push**

3 - Check that your GitHub repository is updated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/magrichard/testgit)

---

## Import a GitHub repository into RStudio

1 - On GitHub: [create new repo](https://github.com/new) with a README and a description. Leave all the other options as is, then click Submit. (no license, no gitignore...)

2- **CLONE** your repository. **Copy** the web URL


3- In RStudio: Create a New Project > Version Control > Git and **paste** the web URL of the project. Congratulation, you have cloned your new repo.

- => You now have access to Git functionalities within Rstudio

## Collaborative work on GitHub

Option 1 - Equal collaborators: Everyone can pull, commit and push on the same 'master' branch

Option 2 - One coordinator (master branch, owns the project) and one (or more) contributor:

## Collaborative work on GitHub

Option 1 - Equal collaborators: Everyone can pull, commit and push on the same 'master' branch

Option 2 - One coordinator (master branch, owns the project) and one (or more) contributor:

- Fork the original repo

- Clone it, and link it to the master repo 

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/magrichard/testgit.git`

- Uptade your fork with latest changes form the master repo (fetch and merge) 

`git pull upstream master`

- Commit, push on your fork, and create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) (that will be reviewed and accepted by the master)
