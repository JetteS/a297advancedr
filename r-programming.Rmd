In the following, we will consider base `R` concepts that are important but often overlooked by or unknown to `R` users. We hope that this chapter will help you to better understand `R` as a programming language, to avoid common mistakes, and to write more efficient code. 

Some of the examples used in this chapter are taken from [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf) by Patrick Burns, who described his materials in the following way:

## Common mistakes to avoid

In the first part of this chapter, we will look at some common mistakes and how to avoid them. 

### The floating-point error

In `R`, a real number is represented as a floating-point number. A floating-point number is a positive or negative whole number scaled by an integer exponent of a fixed base. 

![](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExa2VidmNuNm16aHI5MjRmZGJ4Ym9xamJzcGhkNzdvdHE1NzhyNGQ4dSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/ghuvaCOI6GOoTX0RmH/giphy.gif)

It is actually not that complicated. For example, 12.568 is a floating-point number in base ten with five digits of precision:
$$
12.568 = \underbrace{12568}_\text{whole number} \times {\underbrace{10}_\text{base}}^{\overbrace{-3}^\text{integer exponent}}
$$
Base ten is the most convenient base to understand how floating-point numbers are represented. But you can use any base. For example, in base five, 12.568 is represented by
$$
12.568 = \underbrace{22241}_\text{whole number} \times {\underbrace{5}_\text{base}}^{\overbrace{-3}^\text{integer exponent}},
$$
i.e. a floating-point number with five digits of precision. You can validate that this is indeed the right representation  
$$
\begin{align*}
22241 \times 5^{-3} &= (2 \times 5^{4} + 2 \times 5^{3} + 2 \times 5^{2} + 4 \times 5^{1} + 1 \times 5^{0}) \times 5^{-3}\\
&= 2 \times 5^{1} + 2 \times 5^{0} + 2 \times 5^{-1} + 4 \times 5^{-2} + 1 \times 5^{-3}\\
&= 10 + 2 + 0,4 + 0,16 + 0.008\\
&= 12.568.
\end{align*}
$$
In base two, the representation is more complex:
$$
12.568 = \underbrace{1100 1001 0001 0110 1000 0111 0010 1011 0000 0010 0000 1100 0100 1001 1011 1010 011}_\text{whole number} \times {\underbrace{2}_\text{base}}^{\overbrace{-60}^\text{integer exponent}},
$$
but it still has the same form; a positive whole number with 64 digits of precision times the base to the power -60. 

Not all real numbers can be represented by a floating-point number with a predefined precision. The base and the number of digits regulate how precisely a floating point number can be represented. For example, you cannot represent 12.568 as a floating-point number with four digits of precision in base ten, five or two. The nearest whole number of 12586 with only four digits of precision is 1257. Hence, the closest we can get to 12.568 using only four digits of precision in base ten is 12.57. Not too bad.
The nearest whole number of 22241 with only four digits of precision is 2224. Therefore, the closest we can get to 12.568 using only four digits of precision in base five is 12.56. A bit worse than in base ten.
However, the nearest whole number of 1100100100010110100001110010101100000010000011000100100110111010011 with only four digits of precision in base 2 is 1100. This means that the closest we can get to 12.568 using only four digits of precision in base five is 12. A difference of 0.568 may not be problematic in some cases, but it can be catastrophic in others.


`R` uses base 2 with (usually) 53 digits of precision. Hence, all floating-point numbers with more than 53 digits of precision will be represented by the nearest floating-point number with 53 digits of precision. 
For example, take the real number 0.3. In base two, 0.3 is represented by 0.0100110011001100110011001100... (a number with infinitely many digits of precision). The nearest floating-point number with only 53 digits of precision is 0.299999999999999988897769753748434595763683319091796875, which is the floating-point number `R` uses to represent 0.3. 
```{r, tidy='styler', echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
sprintf("%.54f", 0.3)
```
The binary representation is not perfect, but it is the best approximation `R` has.

When you assign the value 0.3 to an object and print the object to the console afterwards, you will see that `R` returns 0.3:
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
x <- 0.3
x
```
So you may think _Why did you bother me with all that talk about floating-point numbers? There is clearly no problem here!_

However, per default, the function `print()` only prints 7 significant digits when printing numeric values.
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
getOption("digits")
```
If you increase that number to 22, you can see that 0.3 is actually represented by 0.2999999999999999888978
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
print(x, digits = 22)
```

This inaccuracy is known as the **floating-point error**, and it is the reason why simple comparisons like the following can fail: 
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
(0.1 + 0.2) == 0.3
```
Instead of using `==` to compare two objects, use the base `R` function `all.equal()` to test if two objects are equal up to some tolerance ($1.5\times 10^{-8}$ per default). 
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, tolerance = 0)
all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, tolerance = 1e-16)
all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, tolerance = 1e-15)
```
As `all.equal()` returns either `TRUE` or a string with the mean relative difference, you cannot use it directly in `if` expressions. Use `isTRUE(all.equal())` instead:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
isTRUE(all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.4))
```
Alternatively, you can use the `dplyr` function `near()`
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
dplyr::near(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) 
dplyr::near(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, tol = 1e-17) 
```


### The `...` argument

Another source of mistakes often occur in connection to arguments. To illustrate the problem, let us consider a simple example. Assume we have three observations $-1, 5 \text{ and }118$, and we want to find the minimum, maximum, mean, and median in `R`. We know that we can use the functions `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, and `median()` to obtain the desired numbers, so we run the following code:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
min(-1, 5, 118)
max(-1, 5, 118)
mean(-1, 5, 118)
median(-1, 5, 118)
```
The first two numbers are correct, but what is happening with the last two function calls?

The problem is that the four functions take different arguments. Let us take a look at the arguments for `max()` first:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
args(max)
```
The first argument is `...` (dot dot dot). The three dots represent a special argument that allows functions to take any number of arguments - besides all other specified arguments. This means `...` will take all unnamed arguments passed to the function. In the example above, none of the parameters are specified by name, and `max()` will use $-1, 5 \text{ and }118$ to compute the maximum value. 

This is different in connection to the function `mean()`:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
args(mean)
```
The first argument is `x`, which is followed by `...`. As all parameters are unnamed in the function call `mean(-1, 5, 118)`, `mean()` takes the first value $-1$ to compute the mean, and passes all other arguments to another function. Therefore, `mean(-1, 5, 118)` returns $-1$. 

In this simple example, one solution is to store all observations in a vector and pass the vector to the functions:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
min(c(-1, 5, 118))
max(c(-1, 5, 118))
mean(c(-1, 5, 118))
median(c(-1, 5, 118))
```

In more complex cases, you have to be more cautious. When a function has `...` as one of its arguments, misspelled or non-existing arguments will simple be passed on and not raise an error. This increases the change of typos or wrong computations to go unnoticed. Furthermore, the argument `...` is greedy, which is why you often have to name all arguments that you want to pass to the function.

```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
max(c(-1, 5, 118, NA))
max(c(-1, 5, 118, NA), TRUE)
max(c(-1, 5, 118, NA), na.rm = TRUE)

```

If you want to know what other arguments `...` represents, you can look in the function documentation. The function `plot()`, for example, takes the arguments `...`. When you read the function documentation (by running `?plot`), you can see that `...` represents *other graphical parameters*, and the documentation refers to the documentation for graphical parameters for details.

### Others

`R` has many base functions that behave differently than you may expect. One of them is `sample()`. `sample()` creates a sample of a specified size from the elements of the first argument `x` with or without replacement. The most common use of `sample()` is probably to let `x` be a vector:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
sample(1:10)
```
But have you ever tried to pass a single number? Or even a real number?
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sample(10)
sample(10.1)
```
What do you think `R` returns?
<details><summary>Show me!</summary>
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
sample(10)
sample(10.1)
```
Did you expect this outcome? In case you are confused, here is the reason why:. 

The first argument of `sample()` is `x`. `x` can either be a vector of one or more elements from which to choose, or a positive integer. If `x` has length one, is numeric and larger than 1, the sampling will take place from the sequence `1:x`. On the other hand, `1:x` generates a vector of real numbers; starting with 1 and increasing with 1 until the upper limit `x` is reached. Hence, when `x` = 10.1, `1:x` is equal to the sequence `1,2,...,10`, and `sample(x)` is equivalent to `sample(1:10)`.

<br>
This leads us to the next base `R` function with an unexpected behavior; the colon operator `:`. It can be used to generate regular sequences and is equivalent to `seq()` (if `from` and `to` are not factors). Do you know what the output of the following code will be?
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
n <- 10
1:n-1
```

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
n <- 10
1:n-1
```
The result is the sequence from 0 to 9; not 1 to 9. To understand why `1:n-1` returns `0,1,...,9`, we take a look at the syntax documentation (`?Syntax`):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/syntax_documentation.jpg")
```

The documentation shows that the colon operator `:` has a higher precedence than the operator `-`. Hence, `1:n` is evaluated first, and `-` is evaluated afterwards (`1:n-1` is equivalent to `(1:n)-1`). To obtain a sequence from 1 to 9, we can change the order of evaluation by using parentheses: 
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
1:(n-1)
```
Alternatively, we could use the function `seq_len()` to create a sequence that starts at 1 and with steps of 1 finishes at the number passed to the function. 
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
seq_len(n)
seq_len(n-1)
```
However, there is one crucial difference between `1:n` and `seq_len(n)`, which we will look at in the final example!
</details>
<br>
What does the colon operator return when n is equal to 0?
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
n <- 0
1:n
```

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
n <- 0
1:n
```
Did you expect the output to be `1, 0`? The colon operator can also generate a sequence from `from` to `to` in steps of -1 (when `to` < `from`). This behavior can be useful in general, but when `:` is used in a for loop it is often undesired. In situations like that, use the function `seq_len()` instead. When zero is passed as an argument, `seq_len` returns a empty integer vector (`integer(0)`):
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
seq_len(0)
```

`seq_len()` also has a sibling, `seq_along()`, that can be used generate a sequence that is as long as another vector. More precisely, if `x` is a vector of length $\geq$ 1, `seq_along(x)` is a shortcut for `seq_len(length(x))`:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
seq_along(5:7)
```

## Data structures in `R`

`R` provides a number of data structures, i.e. particular ways of organizing data to make their use more effective. These data structures are referred to as objects. In this chapter, we will take a look at the most frequently used objects in `R`. 

### Types

All `R` objects have a type. `R` supports more than 20 different types (see all of them [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects)), but we will only focus on four of six basic (*atomic*) vector types in this section, namely `logical`, `integer`, `double` (often called `numeric`), and `character`.
Atomic vectors represent the most simple data structure in `R`. They are one dimensional and homogeneous, which means that all contents must be of the same type. Single numbers, such as `12.568`, and strings, such as `Hello world`, are vectors; just of length 1. 
The fact that all components of an atomic vectors must be of the same type means that they are often coerced to different types during operations. `R` objects are coerced according to the following precedence:

- `logical` : Logical vectors have the lowest precedence. Whenever a logical vector is combined with a vector of another type, the logical vector will be turned into the other type. 
- `integer` : Integer vectors have the second lowest precedence. Combining an integer vector with a vector of type `double` or `character`, will result in a vector of type `double` or `character`, respectively.
- `double` : Vectors of type `double` have the second highest precedence. They will only change type when they are combined with a vector of type `character`.
- `character` : Character vectors are never coerced. When you combine two or more vectors, one of them being of type `character`, the resulting vector will be of type `character` as well. 

In most situations, you do not have to worry about coercion, as `R` usually coerces the relevant objects automatically. However, some functions may not be able to coerce objects (due to the precedence). In those cases, `R` returns an error. Let us consider some examples. We define four vectors, one of each type:

```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
(logi_vec <- FALSE)
typeof(logi_vec)

(int_vec <- 1:10)
typeof(int_vec)

(dbl_vec <- c(2.5, 12.568))
typeof(dbl_vec)

(char_vec <- c("abc"))
typeof(char_vec)

```

What is the type of each of the resulting vectors below?
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
c(logi_vec, int_vec)

c(int_vec, dbl_vec)

c(logi_vec, char_vec)
```

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, attr.source='.numberLines'}
typeof(c(logi_vec, int_vec))

typeof(c(int_vec, dbl_vec))

typeof(c(logi_vec, char_vec))
```

Line 1: The logical vector `logi_vec` is coerced to an integer vector (`FALSE` is coerced to `0`), and the resulting vector is of type `integer`.
Line 3: The integer vector `int_vec` is coerced to a double vector, which is why `c(int_vec, dbl_vec)` is of type `double`. 
Line 5: The logical vector `logi_vec` is coerced to a character vector, and the result is a vector of type `character`.
</details>
<br>

What is the result of the following operations? Is `R` able to coerce the objects into the required type, or will it return an error?
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
logi_vec < char_vec

min(int_vec, dbl_vec)

logi_vec + char_vec
```

<details><summary>Show me!</summary>
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, attr.source='.numberLines', error=TRUE}
logi_vec < char_vec

min(int_vec, dbl_vec)

logi_vec + char_vec
```

Line 1: The logical vector `logi_vec` is coerced to a character vector. The operator `<` is able to compare strings (using lexicographic orders), and as `F` comes after `a` in the alphabet, the comparison returns `FALSE`.
Line 3: The integer vector `int_vec` is coerced to a double vector, and `min(int_vec, dbl_vec)` returns `1`. 
Line 5: The logical vector `logi_vec` can be coerced to a character vector, but `char_vec` cannot be coreced to a integer or double vector. As `+` is only implemented for numeric or complex vectors, `R` returns an error.

```
3. What do you need to change in the code above to obtain an integer matrix immediately?


### Objects and attributes

In the previous section, we have introduced the most simple data structure in `R`: atomic vectors. Recall that atomic vectors are one dimensional and homogeneous, which means that all components must be of the same base type (`logical`, `integer`, `double`, or `character`). `R` provides another one-dimensional data structure; generic vectors, better known as lists. The important difference between atomic vectors and generic vectors/lists is that lists can contain different types, i.e. lists are heterogeneous.

All vectors (i.e. atomic and generic) can have one or more *attributes*. Attributes are name-value pairs that attach metadata to an object. They can be accessed and modified with `attributes()` (to get a list of all attributes) and `attr()` (to access individual components). By adding specific attributes to vectors, we obtain other important data structures like matrices, arrays, and data frames. 

Two-dimensional matrices and multi-dimensional arrays are obtained from atomic vectors by adding the dimensions attribute `dim`:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
# Defining an atomic vector
(vec <- 1:12)
attributes(vec)

# Modifying the attribute 'dim'
dim(vec) <- c(3, 4)
vec
attributes(vec)
class(vec)

# Modifying the attribute 'dim' once more
dim(vec) <- c(3, 2, 2)
vec
attributes(vec)
class(vec)
```
Instead of modifying the attribute using the function `dim()`, you can simple use the functions `matrix()` or `array()`:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
# Defining a matrix
(mat <- matrix(1:12, ncol = 4, nrow = 3))
attributes(mat)
dim(mat)

# Defining a 3-dimensional array
(arry <- array(1:12, c(3, 2, 2)))
attributes(arry)
dim(arry)
```

Data frames are similar to matrices in that they are two-dimensional structures. However, data frames are based on generic vectors, i.e. a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors.
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(12.568, 12.569, 12.57)
y <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
z <- c("a", "b", "c")

(df <- data.frame(a, b, y, z))
```
Because of their definition, data frames share properties of both the matrix and the list. For instance, the dimension of a data frame correspond to the dimension  of a matrix (number of observations, i.e. the length of the atomic vectors, times the number of variables, i.e. the length of the list). But the length of a data frame is equal to the length of the list; not the total number of observations as for matrices:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
dim(df)
length(df)
```
Another important difference between matrices and data frames is that, per default, data frames have three attributes, whereas matrices only have one:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
attributes(df)
```
These attributes are

- `names`, labelling the variables 
- `class`, a vector of character strings giving the names of the classes which the object inherits from
- `row.names`, labelling the cases 

The `names` attribute labels the individual elements of a vector or list. You can name a vector in three ways: 

- when creating it 
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
(a <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3))
```
- by modifying an existing vector's `names` attribute using `names<-`
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
b <- 1:3
names(b) <- c("a", "b", "c")
b
```
- or by creating a modified copy of a vector using `setNames`
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
setNames(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```

The `class` attribute helps `R` to apply the correct function to an object. When a generic function (such as `summary()`) is applied to an object with a `class` attribute (for example `data.frame`) `R` tries to find the class-specific function (e.g. `summary.data.frame()`). If the class-specific function is available, it is applied to the object. If the class name does not produce a suitable function, the default function (e.g. `summary.default()`) is used. 

The `row.names` attribute is similar to the `names` attribute, but instead of labelling the variables it labels the observations/cases/rows. 

Besides `dim`, `names`, `class`, and `row.names`, `R` also provides some other attributes that we will not discuss here. 
We want to note, however, that you can define your own attributes using the function structure:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
x <- structure(1:10, my_own_attr = "Hello world!")
attributes(x)
```

In most cases, you should not simply remove an attribute from an object, unless you know what you are doing. Otherwise you may end up with very strange results. For example, if you remove the attribute `levels` from a factor, `R` will no longer be able to perform simple operations on that factor:
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
(x <- sample(c("a", "b", "c"), 12, replace = TRUE))
y <- factor(x)
attributes(y)

attr(y, "levels") <- NULL
y
```
And if you remove the attribute `class`, the factor is turned into an atomic vector
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}

y <- factor(x)
attributes(y)

unclass(y)
```

If you remove the only attribute (`class`) from a date vector, the result is a numeric vector representing the number of days since 1970-01-01
```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
(today <- Sys.Date())
attributes(today)
unclass(today)
```
#### Exercise {.unnumbered}

1. Define a simple function that takes two arguments (first_name and last_name) and that returns an object of class "Person".


### Accessors

In the previous section, we have seen how we can adding attributes to vectors in order to obtain other important data structures like matrices, arrays, and data frames. Furthermore, we mentioned that two-dimensional matrices and multi-dimensional arrays are based on atomic vectors, while data frames are obtained from generic vectors/lists.
We will now see that the choice of vector type (atomic vs. generic) has an effect on the accessibility of elements. 

For two-dimensional matrices, multi-dimensional arrays and data frames, elements can be accessed in different ways. 

Data frames can be subsetted like a one-dimensional structure (where it behaves like a list), or a two-dimensional structure (where it behaves like a matrix).

1. The `[` accessor can be used on vectors, matrices, arrays, lists and data frames to extract or replace subsets of the data **with the same class**.
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    (x <- 1:5)
    x[2:3]
    x[2:8]
    
    (y <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3))
    y[4:9]
    
    (l <- list(a = 2:3, b = "toto", c = runif(10)))
    l[2:3]
    ```
    What does *with the same class* mean? It means that the class of the resulting subset is the same as the     object that was subsetted with `[`. That means, when you subset a vector with the `[` accessor, the         subset is a vector as well. When you subset a list with the `[` accessor, the result is a list: Even if     you only select a single entry of the list.
    
    The index object can be numeric, logical, character, or empty:
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    x[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
    x[c(FALSE, TRUE)]
    
    y[]
    
    l[c("a", "c")]
    l[c(FALSE, TRUE)]
    ```

    Besides using a single vector to subset matrices, arrays and data frames, you can also specify several      indices to `[` to obtain two-dimensional subsets. An empty index indicates that all entries in that         dimension are selected:
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    y[2:3]
    y[2:3, ]
    y[, 2:3]
    y[2, 3]
    ```
    Matrices and arrays can also be indexed via a numeric matrix with one column for each dimension. Each       row of the index matrix then selects a single element of the array:
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    two_col_ind <- cbind(c(1, 3, 2), c(1, 4, 2))
    y[two_col_ind]
    ```

2. The `[[` and the `$` accessor are both operators to access or replace **a single element**. However, while `[[` can be used on vectors, matrices, arrays, lists and data frames, the `$` accessor does only work on lists and data frames. 
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
    x[[3]]
    l[[2]]
    l[["c"]]
    l$c
    
    names(x) <- letters[1:5]
    x
    x$e
    ```
    You can see that for the atomic vector `x`, `x[3]` and `x[[3]]` result in the same output; a vector of      length one. But for the list `l`, the `[` accessor returns a list with one entry, while `[[` returns a      matrix. You can think of a list as a pepper pot, each entry of the list being a sachet of pepper. The       `[` accessor extracts the desired sachets, but they are still contained within the pot. The `[[`            accessor takes the desired sachets out of the pot.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Indexing lists in R. [Source: https://goo.gl/8UkcHq]"}
    knitr::include_graphics("https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQ5en8XWAAICIaJ.jpg")
    ```

    Besides the fact that the `$` accessor cannot be used on atomic vectors, matrices or arrays, the main       difference between `[[` and `$` is that `$` does not allow computed indices:
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE, error=TRUE}
    l[[2 - 1]]
    l$(2-1)
    ```

Before we move on to some exercises, we have two more comments. 

1. Per default, the `[[` accessor only extracts columns if their column names match one of the strings provided in a character vector exactly. That means, if you want to extract a list entry named `aaakv` using `[[a]]`, the result will be `NULL`:
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    names(l) <- c("aaakv", "b", "c")
    l
    
    l$a
    l[["a"]]
    ```
    To allow for partial matching, use `exact = FALSE`:
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    l[["a", exact = FALSE]]
    ```

2. Per default, the `[` accessor coerces the result to the lowest possible dimension. For example, if you extract a single row from a matrix using `[`, the result will be a vector:
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    y
    y[1,]
    ```
    To change this behavior, set `drop = FALSE`
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    y[1, , drop = FALSE]
    ```


### Exercises {.unnumbered}

1. In which order are matrix elements stored? 
2. Use the dimension attribute to make a function that computes the sum of every n successive elements of a vector. <br>
Ex: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -> expected outcome: 3 7 11 15 19<br>
[Which are the special cases that you should consider?]
3. Convert the following matrix to a vector by using this replacement rule for rows:<br>
  (0, 0) -> 0<br>
  (0, 1) -> 1<br>
  (1, 1) -> 2<br>
  (1, 0) -> NA<br>
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    mat <- matrix(0, 10, 2) 
    mat[c(5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19)] <- 1
    mat
    ```
    You have to use the following matrix to do so:
    ```{r, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    (decode <- matrix(c(0, NA, 1, 2), 2))
    ```
    Start by doing it for one row, then by using `apply()`. Finally, replace it by a special accessor. 
    Expected result:
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, tidy='styler', collapse=TRUE}
    decode[mat + 1]
    ```

## Useful R base functions

In this section, I present some useful R base functions (also see [this comprehensive list in French](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Kauffmann_aide_memoire_R.pdf) and [this one in English](https://github.com/peterhurford/adv-r-book-solutions/blob/master/03_vocab/functions.r)):

### General

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# To get some help
?topic

# Run code from the example section
example(sum)
```

```{r}
# Structure overview
str(iris)  ## skimr::skim(iris) is also very useful

# List objects in the environment
ls()

# Remove objects from the environment
rm(list = ls())  ## remove all objects in the global environment
```

```{r}
# For a particular method, list available implementations for different classes 
methods(summary)
# List methods available for a particular class
methods(class = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Call a function with arguments as a list
(list_of_int <- as.list(1:5))
do.call('c', list_of_int)
```


### Sequence and vector operations

```{r}
1:10  ## of type integer
seq(1, 10, by = 2)  ## of type double
seq(1, 100, length.out = 10)
seq_len(5)
seq_along(21:24)
rep(1:4, 2)
rep(1:4, each = 2)
rep(1:4, 4:1)
rep_len(1:3, 8)
replicate(5, rnorm(10))  ## How to use a multiline expression?
```

```{r}
sort(c(1, 6, 8, 2, 2))
order(c(1, 6, 8, 2, 2), c(0, 0, 0, 2, 1))
rank(c(1, 6, 8, 2, 2))
rank(c(1, 6, 8, 2, 2), ties.method = "first")
sort(c("a1", "a2", "a10"))
gtools::mixedsort(c("a1", "a2", "a10"))  ## not in base, but useful
which.max(c(1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 0))
which.min(c(1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 0))
unique(c(1, NA, 2, 3, 2, NA, 3))
table(rep(1:4, 4:1))
table(A = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2), B = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1))
sample(10)
sample(3:10, 5)
sample(3:10, 50, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
round(x <- runif(10, max = 100))  ## 10 random numbers between 0 and 100
round(x, digits = 2)
round(x, -1)
pmin(1:4, 4:1)
pmax(1:4, 4:1)
outer(1:4, 1:3, '+')
expand.grid(param1 = c(5, 50), param2 = c(1, 3, 10))
```

Also see [this nice Q/A on grouping functions and the *apply family](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3505701/grouping-functions-tapply-by-aggregate-and-the-apply-family) and [this book chapter about looping](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/loop-functions.html).

### Character operations

```{r}
paste("I", "am", "me")
paste0("test", 0)
paste0("PC", 1:10)
me <- "Florian"
glue::glue("I am {me}")  ## not in base, but so useful
(x <- list.files(pattern = "\\.Rmd$", full.names = TRUE))
sub("\\.Rmd$", ".pdf", x)
(y <- sample(letters[1:4], 10, replace = TRUE))
match(y, letters[1:4])
y %in% letters[1:2]
split(1:12, rep(letters[1:3], 4))
intersect(letters[1:4], letters[3:5])
union(letters[1:4], letters[3:5])
setdiff(letters[1:4], letters[3:5])
```

### Logical operators

```{r, error=TRUE}
TRUE | stop("will go there")
TRUE || stop("won't go there")  ## won't evaluate second condition if first one is TRUE
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) & c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) 
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) && c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)  ## /!\ no warning in prior R versions
```

```{r}
(x <- rnorm(10))
ifelse(x > 0, x, -x)  # try to find two other equivalents
```

Beware with `ifelse()` (learn more [there](https://privefl.github.io/blog/On-the-ifelse-function/)), for example 

```{r}
ifelse(FALSE, 0, 1:5)
`if`(FALSE, 0, 1:5)
if (FALSE) 0 else 1:5
```

### Exercises

1. Use `sample()`, `rep_len()` and `split()` to make a function that randomly splits some indices in a list of `K` groups of indices (like for cross-validation). [Which are the special cases that you should consider?]

    ```{r}
    advr38pkg::split_ind(1:40, 3)
    ```

1. Use `replicate()` and `sample()` to get a 95% confidence interval (using bootstrapping) for the mean of the following vector:

    ```{r}
    set.seed(1)
    (x <- rnorm(10))
    mean(x)
    ```
   
    Expected output (approximately): 
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    quantile(replicate(1e6, mean(sample(x, replace = TRUE))), probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
    ```

1. Use `match()` and some special accessor to add a column "my_val" to this data `my_mtcars` by putting the corresponding value of the column specified in "my_col". [Can your solution be used for any number of column names?]

    ```{r}
    my_mtcars <- mtcars[c("mpg", "hp")]
    my_mtcars$my_col <- sample(c("mpg", "hp"), size = nrow(my_mtcars), replace = TRUE)
    head(my_mtcars)
    ```

    Expected result (head):
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    ind <- cbind(seq_len(nrow(my_mtcars)), 
                 match(my_mtcars[["my_col"]], names(my_mtcars)))
    my_mtcars$my_val <- my_mtcars[ind]
    head(my_mtcars)
    ```

1. In the following data frame (recall that a data frame is also a list), for the first 3 columns, replace letters by corresponding numbers based on the `code`:

    ```{r}
    df <- data.frame(
      id1 = c("a", "f", "a"),
      id2 = c("b", "e", "e"), 
      id3 = c("c", "d", "f"),
      inter = c(7.343, 2.454, 3.234),
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
    df
    (code <- setNames(1:6, letters[1:6]))
    ```
    
    Expected result:
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    df[-4] <- lapply(df[-4], function(col) code[col])
    df
    ```


## Environments and scoping

Lexical scoping determines where to look for values, not when to look for them. R looks for values when the function is run, not when it’s created. This means that the output of a function can be different depending on objects outside its environment:

```{r}
h <- function() {
  x <- 10
  f <- function() {
    x + 1
  }
  f()
}
```

```{r}
x <- 100
h()
```

Variable `x` is not defined inside `f` so R will look at the environment of `f` (where `f` was defined) and then at the parent environment, and so on. Here, the first `x` that is found has value `10`.

Be aware that for functions, packages environments are checked last so that you can redefine functions without noticing.

```{r}
c <- function(...) paste0(...)
c(1, 2, 3)
base::c(1, 2, 3)  ## you need to explicit the package
rm(c)  ## remove the new function from the environment
c(1, 2, 3)
```

You can use the `<<-` operator to change the value of an object in an upper environment:

```{r}
count1 <- 0
count2 <- 0
f <- function(i) {
  count1 <-  count1 + 1  ## will assign a new (temporary) count1 each time
  count2 <<- count2 + 1  ## will increment count2 on top
  i + 1
}
sapply(1:10, f)
c(count1, count2)
```

Finally, how does `...` work? Basically, you copy and paste what is put in `...`:

```{r}
f1 <- function(...) {
  list(...)
}
f1(a = 2, b = 3)
list(a = 2, b = 3)
```

Learn more about [functions](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/functions.html) and [scoping rules of R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/scoping-rules-of-r.html) with the [R Programming for Data Science book](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/).


## Attributes and classes

Attributes are metadata associated with an object. You can get/set the list of attributes with `attributes()` or one particular attribute with `attr()`.

```{r}
attributes(iris)
class(iris)
attr(iris, "row.names")
```

You can use `structure()` to create an object and add some arbitrary attributes.

```{r}
structure(1:10, my_fancy_attribute = "blabla")
```

There are also some attributes with specific accessor functions to get and set values. For example, use `names(x)`, `dim(x)` and `class(x)` instead of `attr(x, "names")`, `attr(x, "dim")` and `attr(x, "class")`.

***

```{r}
class(mylm <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = iris))
```

I've just fitted a linear model in order to predict the sepal length variable of the `iris` dataset based on the other variables. Using `lm()` gets me an object of class `lm`. What are the methods I can use for this object?

```{r}
methods(class = class(mylm))
summary(mylm)
plot(mylm)
```

***

R has the easiest way to create a class and to use methods on objects of this class; it is called S3. If you want to know more about the other types of classes, see the [Advanced R book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

```{r}
agent007 <- list(first = "James", last = "Bond")
agent007
```

```{r}
class(agent007) <- "Person"  ## "agent007" is now an object of class "Person"
# Just make a function called <method_name>.<class_name>()
print.Person <- function(x) {
  print(glue::glue("My name is {x$last}, {x$first} {x$last}."))
  invisible(x)
}

agent007
```

```{r}
# Constructor of class as simple function
Person <- function(first, last) {
  structure(list(first = first, last = last), class = "Person")
}
(me <- Person("Florian", "Privé"))
```

An object can have many classes:

```{r}
Worker <- function(first, last, job) {
  obj <- Person(first, last)
  obj$job <- job
  class(obj) <- c("Worker", class(obj))
  obj
}
print.Worker <- function(x) {
  print.Person(x) 
  print(glue::glue("I am a {x$job}."))
  invisible(x)
}

(worker_007 <- Worker("James", "Bond", "secret agent"))
(worker_me <- Worker("Florian", "Privé", "researcher"))
```

## Summary

Data frames can be subsetted like a one-dimensional structure (where it behaves like a list), or a two-dimensional structure (where it behaves like a matrix).
