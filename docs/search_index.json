We hope that this chapter will help you to better understand R as a programming language, to avoid common mistakes, and to write more efficient code. Some of the examples used in this chapter are taken from The R Inferno by Patrick Burns, who described his materials in the following way: If you are using R and you think you’re in hell, this is a map for you. — Patrick Burns 3.1 Common mistakes to avoid In the first part of this chapter, we will look at some common mistakes and how to avoid them. 3.1.1 The floating-point error In R, a real number is represented as a floating-point number. A floating-point number is a positive or negative whole number scaled by an integer exponent of a fixed base. It is actually not that complicated. For example, 12.568 is a floating-point number in base ten with five digits of precision: \\[ 12.568 = \\underbrace{12568}_\\text{whole number} \\times {\\underbrace{10}_\\text{base}}^{\\overbrace{-3}^\\text{integer exponent}} \\] Base ten is the most convenient base to understand how floating-point numbers are represented. But you can use any base. For example, in base five, 12.568 is represented by \\[ 12.568 = \\underbrace{22241}_\\text{whole number} \\times {\\underbrace{5}_\\text{base}}^{\\overbrace{-3}^\\text{integer exponent}}, \\] i.e. a floating-point number with five digits of precision. You can validate that this is indeed the right representation \\[ \\begin{align*} 22241 \\times 5^{-3} &amp;= (2 \\times 5^{4} + 2 \\times 5^{3} + 2 \\times 5^{2} + 4 \\times 5^{1} + 1 \\times 5^{0}) \\times 5^{-3}\\\\ &amp;= 2 \\times 5^{1} + 2 \\times 5^{0} + 2 \\times 5^{-1} + 4 \\times 5^{-2} + 1 \\times 5^{-3}\\\\ &amp;= 10 + 2 + 0,4 + 0,16 + 0.008\\\\ &amp;= 12.568. \\end{align*} \\] In base two, the representation is more complex: \\[ 12.568 = \\underbrace{1100 1001 0001 0110 1000 0111 0010 1011 0000 0010 0000 1100 0100 1001 1011 1010 011}_\\text{whole number} \\times {\\underbrace{2}_\\text{base}}^{\\overbrace{-60}^\\text{integer exponent}}, \\] but it still has the same form; a positive whole number with 64 digits of precision times the base to the power -60. Not all real numbers can be represented by a floating-point number with a predefined precision. The base and the number of digits regulate how precisely a floating point number can be represented. For example, you cannot represent 12.568 as a floating-point number with four digits of precision in base ten, five or two. The nearest whole number of 12586 with only four digits of precision is 1257. Hence, the closest we can get to 12.568 using only four digits of precision in base ten is 12.57. Not too bad. The nearest whole number of 22241 with only four digits of precision is 2224. Therefore, the closest we can get to 12.568 using only four digits of precision in base five is 12.56. A bit worse than in base ten. However, the nearest whole number of 1100100100010110100001110010101100000010000011000100100110111010011 with only four digits of precision in base 2 is 1100. This means that the closest we can get to 12.568 using only four digits of precision in base five is 12. A difference of 0.568 may not be problematic in some cases, but it can be catastrophic in others. R uses base 2 with (usually) 53 digits of precision. Hence, all floating-point numbers with more than 53 digits of precision will be represented by the nearest floating-point number with 53 digits of precision. For example, take the real number 0.3. In base two, 0.3 is represented by 0.0100110011001100110011001100… (a number with infinitely many digits of precision). The nearest floating-point number with only 53 digits of precision is 0.299999999999999988897769753748434595763683319091796875, which is the floating-point number R uses to represent 0.3. The binary representation is not perfect, but it is the best approximation R has. When you assign the value 0.3 to an object and print the object to the console afterwards, you will see that R returns 0.3: x &lt;- 0.3 x #&gt; [1] 0.3 So you may think Why did you bother me with all that talk about floating-point numbers? There is clearly no problem here! However, per default, the function print() only prints 7 significant digits when printing numeric values. getOption(&quot;digits&quot;) #&gt; [1] 7 If you increase that number to 22, you can see that 0.3 is actually represented by 0.2999999999999999888978 print(x, digits = 22) #&gt; [1] 0.2999999999999999888978 This inaccuracy is known as the floating-point error, and it is the reason why simple comparisons like the following can fail: (0.1 + 0.2) == 0.3 #&gt; [1] FALSE Instead of using == to compare two objects, use the base R function all.equal() to test if two objects are equal up to some tolerance (\\(1.5\\times 10^{-8}\\) per default). all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) #&gt; [1] TRUE all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, tolerance = 0) #&gt; [1] &quot;Mean relative difference: 1.850372e-16&quot; all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, tolerance = 1e-16) #&gt; [1] &quot;Mean relative difference: 1.850372e-16&quot; all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, tolerance = 1e-15) #&gt; [1] TRUE As all.equal() returns either TRUE or a string with the mean relative difference, you cannot use it directly in if expressions. Use isTRUE(all.equal()) instead: isTRUE(all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.4)) #&gt; [1] FALSE Alternatively, you can use the dplyr function near() dplyr::near(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) #&gt; [1] TRUE dplyr::near(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3, tol = 1e-17) #&gt; [1] FALSE 3.1.2 The ... argument Another source of mistakes often occur in connection to arguments. To illustrate the problem, let us consider a simple example. Assume we have three observations \\(-1, 5 \\text{ and }118\\), and we want to find the minimum, maximum, mean, and median in R. We know that we can use the functions min(), max(), mean(), and median() to obtain the desired numbers, so we run the following code: min(-1, 5, 118) #&gt; [1] -1 max(-1, 5, 118) #&gt; [1] 118 mean(-1, 5, 118) #&gt; [1] -1 median(-1, 5, 118) #&gt; [1] -1 The first two numbers are correct, but what is happening with the last two function calls? The problem is that the four functions take different arguments. Let us take a look at the arguments for max() first: args(max) #&gt; function (..., na.rm = FALSE) #&gt; NULL The first argument is ... (dot dot dot). The three dots represent a special argument that allows functions to take any number of arguments - besides all other specified arguments. This means ... will take all unnamed arguments passed to the function. In the example above, none of the parameters are specified by name, and max() will use \\(-1, 5 \\text{ and }118\\) to compute the maximum value. This is different in connection to the function mean(): args(mean) #&gt; function (x, ...) #&gt; NULL The first argument is x, which is followed by .... As all parameters are unnamed in the function call mean(-1, 5, 118), mean() takes the first value \\(-1\\) to compute the mean, and passes all other arguments to another function. Therefore, mean(-1, 5, 118) returns \\(-1\\). In this simple example, one solution is to store all observations in a vector and pass the vector to the functions: min(c(-1, 5, 118)) #&gt; [1] -1 max(c(-1, 5, 118)) #&gt; [1] 118 mean(c(-1, 5, 118)) #&gt; [1] 40.66667 median(c(-1, 5, 118)) #&gt; [1] 5 In more complex cases, you have to be more cautious. When a function has ... as one of its arguments, misspelled or non-existing arguments will simple be passed on and not raise an error. This increases the change of typos or wrong computations to go unnoticed. Furthermore, the argument ... is greedy, which is why you often have to name all arguments that you want to pass to the function. max(c(-1, 5, 118, NA)) #&gt; [1] NA max(c(-1, 5, 118, NA), TRUE) #&gt; [1] NA max(c(-1, 5, 118, NA), na.rm = TRUE) #&gt; [1] 118 If you want to know what other arguments ... represents, you can look in the function documentation. The function plot(), for example, takes the arguments .... When you read the function documentation (by running ?plot), you can see that ... represents other graphical parameters, and the documentation refers to the documentation for graphical parameters for details. 3.1.3 Others R has many base functions that behave differently than you may expect. One of them is sample(). sample() creates a sample of a specified size from the elements of the first argument x with or without replacement. The most common use of sample() is probably to let x be a vector: sample(1:10) #&gt; [1] 7 3 5 8 9 2 6 1 4 10 But have you ever tried to pass a single number? Or even a real number? sample(10) sample(10.1) What do you think R returns? Show me! sample(10) #&gt; [1] 8 2 9 4 5 1 7 3 6 10 sample(10.1) #&gt; [1] 3 8 4 2 9 5 7 1 10 6 Did you expect this outcome? In case you are confused, here is the reason why:. The first argument of sample() is x. x can either be a vector of one or more elements from which to choose, or a positive integer. If x has length one, is numeric and larger than 1, the sampling will take place from the sequence 1:x. On the other hand, 1:x generates a vector of real numbers; starting with 1 and increasing with 1 until the upper limit x is reached. Hence, when x = 10.1, 1:x is equal to the sequence 1,2,...,10, and sample(x) is equivalent to sample(1:10). This leads us to the next base R function with an unexpected behavior; the colon operator :. It can be used to generate regular sequences and is equivalent to seq() (if from and to are not factors). Do you know what the output of the following code will be? n &lt;- 10 1:n - 1 Show me! n &lt;- 10 1:n - 1 #&gt; [1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The result is the sequence from 0 to 9; not 1 to 9. To understand why 1:n-1 returns 0,1,...,9, we take a look at the syntax documentation (?Syntax): The documentation shows that the colon operator : has a higher precedence than the operator -. Hence, 1:n is evaluated first, and - is evaluated afterwards (1:n-1 is equivalent to (1:n)-1). To obtain a sequence from 1 to 9, we can change the order of evaluation by using parentheses: 1:(n - 1) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Alternatively, we could use the function seq_len() to create a sequence that starts at 1 and with steps of 1 finishes at the number passed to the function. seq_len(n) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 seq_len(n - 1) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 However, there is one crucial difference between 1:n and seq_len(n), which we will look at in the final example! What does the colon operator return when n is equal to 0? n &lt;- 0 1:n Show me! n &lt;- 0 1:n #&gt; [1] 1 0 Did you expect the output to be 1, 0? The colon operator can also generate a sequence from from to to in steps of -1 (when to &lt; from). This behavior can be useful in general, but when : is used in a for loop it is often undesired. In situations like that, use the function seq_len() instead. When zero is passed as an argument, seq_len returns a empty integer vector (integer(0)): seq_len(0) #&gt; integer(0) seq_len() also has a sibling, seq_along(), that can be used generate a sequence that is as long as another vector. More precisely, if x is a vector of length \\(\\geq\\) 1, seq_along(x) is a shortcut for seq_len(length(x)): seq_along(5:7) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 3.2 Useful R functions Now that you have seen common mistakes in R and learned how to avoid them, we will take a look at some useful base R functions. Some of them may be known to you, but we still recommend that you inspect the list. General ?topic : Open the documentation on a topic (typically a function or data set) in the Files pane.

Can be used in different ways: By specifying by(the increment of the sequence), length.out (the desired length of the sequence), or along.with (taking the length from the length of this argument). Note that seq_len(length.out) is a shortcut for seq(from = 1, to = length.out, by = 1), and that seg_along(along.with) is a shortcut for seq(from = 1, to = length(along.with), by = 1). seq(1, 10, by = 2) #&gt; [1] 1 3 5 7 9 seq(1, 100, length.out = 10) #&gt; [1] 1 12 23 34 45 56 67 78 89 100 seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 seq_len(5) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 seq_along(21:24) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 seq(from = 1, to = length(21:24), by = 1) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 rep(x) : Replicate the values in x. Can be used in different ways: By specifying times (the number of times to repeat each element or the whole vector), length.out (the desired length of the output vector), or each (the number of times each element of x is repeated). Note that rep_len(x, length.out) is a shortcut for rep(x, length.out = length.out), and that rep.int(x, times) is a shortcut for rep(x, times = times). rep(1:4, times = 2) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 rep.int(1:4, 2) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 rep(1:4, times = 4:1) #&gt; [1] 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 rep(1:4, length.out = 6) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 1 2 rep_len(1:4, 6) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 1 2 rep(1:4, each = 2) #&gt; [1] 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 replicate(n, expr) : Repeated evaluation of an expression.

These data structures are referred to as objects. In this chapter, we will take a look at the most frequently used objects in R. 3.3.1 Types All R objects have a type. R supports more than 20 different types (see all of them here), but we will only focus on four of six basic (atomic) vector types in this section, namely logical, integer, double (often called numeric), and character. Atomic vectors represent the most simple data structure in R. They are one dimensional and homogeneous, which means that all contents must be of the same type. Single numbers, such as 12.568, and strings, such as Hello world, are vectors; just of length 1. The fact that all components of an atomic vectors must be of the same type means that they are often coerced to different types during operations. R objects are coerced according to the following precedence: logical : Logical vectors have the lowest precedence. Whenever a logical vector is combined with a vector of another type, the logical vector will be turned into the other type. integer : Integer vectors have the second lowest precedence. Combining an integer vector with a vector of type double or character, will result in a vector of type double or character, respectively. double : Vectors of type double have the second highest precedence. They will only change type when they are combined with a vector of type character. character : Character vectors are never coerced. When you combine two or more vectors, one of them being of type character, the resulting vector will be of type character as well. In most situations, you do not have to worry about coercion, as R usually coerces the relevant objects automatically. However, some functions may not be able to coerce objects (due to the precedence). In those cases, R returns an error. Let us consider some examples. We define four vectors, one of each type: (logi_vec &lt;- FALSE) #&gt; [1] FALSE typeof(logi_vec) #&gt; [1] &quot;logical&quot; (int_vec &lt;- 1:10) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 typeof(int_vec) #&gt; [1] &quot;integer&quot; (dbl_vec &lt;- c(2.5, 12.568)) #&gt; [1] 2.500 12.568 typeof(dbl_vec) #&gt; [1] &quot;double&quot; (char_vec &lt;- c(&quot;abc&quot;)) #&gt; [1] &quot;abc&quot; typeof(char_vec) #&gt; [1] &quot;character&quot; What is the type of each of the resulting vectors below? c(logi_vec, int_vec) c(int_vec, dbl_vec) c(logi_vec, char_vec) Show me! typeof(c(logi_vec, int_vec)) #&gt; [1] &quot;integer&quot; typeof(c(int_vec, dbl_vec)) #&gt; [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(c(logi_vec, char_vec)) #&gt; [1] &quot;character&quot; Line 1: The logical vector logi_vec is coerced to an integer vector (FALSE is coerced to 0), and the resulting vector is of type integer. Line 3: The integer vector int_vec is coerced to a double vector, which is why c(int_vec, dbl_vec) is of type double. Line 5: The logical vector logi_vec is coerced to a character vector, and the result is a vector of type character. What is the result of the following operations? Is R able to coerce the objects into the required type, or will it return an error? logi_vec &lt; char_vec min(int_vec, dbl_vec) logi_vec + char_vec Show me! logi_vec &lt; char_vec #&gt; [1] FALSE min(int_vec, dbl_vec) #&gt; [1] 1 logi_vec + char_vec #&gt; Error in logi_vec + char_vec: non-numeric argument to binary operator Line 1: The logical vector logi_vec is coerced to a character vector. The operator &lt; is able to compare strings (using lexicographic orders), and as F comes after a in the alphabet, the comparison returns FALSE. Line 3: The integer vector int_vec is coerced to a double vector, and min(int_vec, dbl_vec) returns 1. Line 5: The logical vector logi_vec can be coerced to a character vector, but char_vec cannot be coreced to a integer or double vector. As + is only implemented for numeric or complex vectors, R returns an error. Exercises Why is the default missing value, NA, a logical vector? How can you use the automatic type coercion to convert this boolean matrix to a numeric one (with 0s and 1s)? (mat &lt;- matrix(sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 12, replace = TRUE), nrow = 3)) #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE #&gt; [2,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE #&gt; [3,] FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE What do you need to change in the code above to obtain an integer matrix immediately? 3.3.2 Objects and attributes In the previous section, we have introduced the most simple data structure in R: atomic vectors. Recall that atomic vectors are one dimensional and homogeneous, which means that all components must be of the same base type (logical, integer, double, or character). R provides another one-dimensional data structure; generic vectors, better known as lists. The important difference between atomic vectors and generic vectors/lists is that lists can contain different types, i.e. lists are heterogeneous. All vectors (i.e. atomic and generic) can have one or more attributes. Attributes are name-value pairs that attach metadata to an object. They can be accessed and modified with attributes() (to get a list of all attributes) and attr() (to access a particular component). By adding specific attributes to vectors, we obtain other important data structures like matrices, arrays, and data frames. Two-dimensional matrices and multi-dimensional arrays are obtained from atomic vectors by adding the dimensions attribute dim: # Defining an atomic vector (vec &lt;- 1:12) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 attributes(vec) #&gt; NULL # Modifying the attribute &#39;dim&#39; dim(vec) &lt;- c(3, 4) vec #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 10 #&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 11 #&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 12 attributes(vec) #&gt; $dim #&gt; [1] 3 4 class(vec) #&gt; [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;array&quot; # Modifying the attribute &#39;dim&#39; once more dim(vec) &lt;- c(3, 2, 2) vec #&gt; , , 1 #&gt; #&gt; [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] 1 4 #&gt; [2,] 2 5 #&gt; [3,] 3 6 #&gt; #&gt; , , 2 #&gt; #&gt; [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] 7 10 #&gt; [2,] 8 11 #&gt; [3,] 9 12 attributes(vec) #&gt; $dim #&gt; [1] 3 2 2 class(vec) #&gt; [1] &quot;array&quot; Instead of modifying the attribute using the function dim(), you can simple use the functions matrix() or array(): # Defining a matrix (mat &lt;- matrix(1:12, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)) #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 10 #&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 11 #&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 12 attributes(mat) #&gt; $dim #&gt; [1] 3 4 dim(mat) #&gt; [1] 3 4 # Defining a 3-dimensional array (arry &lt;- array(1:12, c(3, 2, 2))) #&gt; , , 1 #&gt; #&gt; [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] 1 4 #&gt; [2,] 2 5 #&gt; [3,] 3 6 #&gt; #&gt; , , 2 #&gt; #&gt; [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] 7 10 #&gt; [2,] 8 11 #&gt; [3,] 9 12 attributes(arry) #&gt; $dim #&gt; [1] 3 2 2 dim(arry) #&gt; [1] 3 2 2 Data frames are similar to matrices in that they are two-dimensional structures. However, data frames are based on generic vectors, i.e. a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors. a &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) b &lt;- c(12.568, 12.569, 12.57) y &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) z &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) (df &lt;- data.frame(a, b, y, z)) #&gt; a b y z #&gt; 1 1 12.568 TRUE a #&gt; 2 2 12.569 FALSE b #&gt; 3 3 12.570 TRUE c Because of their definition, data frames share properties of both the matrix and the list. For instance, the dimension of a data frame correspond to the dimension of a matrix (number of observations, i.e. the length of the atomic vectors, times the number of variables, i.e. the length of the list). But the length of a data frame is equal to the length of the list; not the total number of observations as for matrices: dim(df) #&gt; [1] 3 4 length(df) #&gt; [1] 4 Another important difference between matrices and data frames is that, per default, data frames have three attributes, whereas matrices only have one: attributes(df) #&gt; $names #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;z&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $class #&gt; [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $row.names #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 These attributes are names, labelling the variables class, a vector of character strings giving the names of the classes which the object inherits from row.names, labelling the cases The names attribute labels the individual elements of a vector or list. You can name a vector in three ways: when creating it (a &lt;- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)) #&gt; a b c #&gt; 1 2 3 by modifying an existing vector’s names attribute using names&lt;- b &lt;- 1:3 names(b) &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) b #&gt; a b c #&gt; 1 2 3 or by creating a modified copy of a vector using setNames setNames(1:3, c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)) #&gt; a b c #&gt; 1 2 3 The class attribute helps R to apply the correct function to an object. When a generic function (such as summary()) is applied to an object with a class attribute (for example data.frame) R tries to find the class-specific function (e.g. summary.data.frame()). A class-specific function is called method. If the class-specific function is available, it is applied to the object. If the class name does not produce a suitable function, the default function (e.g. summary.default()) is used. Please note that an object can have many classes. In that case, R will go through all classes, one at a time, and use the first method that is available. For example, when applying a function fct() on the object tbl specified below, R will look for the function fct.tbl_df() first. If the function exists, it will be applied. If not, R will look for the function fct.tbl(). If fct.tbl() is defined, it will be applied to tbl. Otherwise, R will look for the function fct.data.frame(). If the function exists, it will be applied. If not, R will apply fct.default(). tbl &lt;- tibble::tibble(first = &quot;James&quot;, last = &quot;Bond&quot;) class(tbl) #&gt; [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; If you want to find all methods that can be used on an object of a particular class, use methods(class = [class]), i.e. methods(class = &quot;data.frame&quot;) #&gt; [1] $&lt;- [ [[ [[&lt;- [&lt;- aggregate #&gt; [7] anyDuplicated anyNA as.data.frame as.list as.matrix as.vector #&gt; [13] by cbind coerce dim dimnames dimnames&lt;- #&gt; [19] droplevels duplicated edit filter format formula #&gt; [25] head initialize intersect is.na Math merge #&gt; [31] na.exclude na.omit Ops plot print prompt #&gt; [37] rbind row.names row.names&lt;- rowsum setdiff setequal #&gt; [43] show slotsFromS3 sort_by split split&lt;- stack #&gt; [49] str subset summary Summary t tail #&gt; [55] transform type.convert union unique unstack within #&gt; [61] xtfrm #&gt; see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code The row.names attribute is similar to the names attribute, but instead of labelling the variables it labels the observations/cases/rows. Besides dim, names, class, and row.names, R also provides some other attributes that we will not discuss here. We want to note, however, that you can define your own attributes using the function structure: x &lt;- structure(1:10, my_own_attr = &quot;Hello world!&quot;) attributes(x) #&gt; $my_own_attr #&gt; [1] &quot;Hello world!&quot; If you simply want to define your own class, however, it is easier to use the function class() directly on the object: (agent007 &lt;- list(first = &quot;James&quot;, last = &quot;Bond&quot;)) #&gt; $first #&gt; [1] &quot;James&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $last #&gt; [1] &quot;Bond&quot; class(agent007) &lt;- &quot;Person&quot; attr(agent007, &quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;Person&quot; Once you have created your own class, you can define class-specific functions as described above. A class-specific function is simply a function called &lt;method_name&gt;.&lt;class_name&gt;() For the object agent007 of class Person, we may want to define a special printfunction: print.Person &lt;- function(x) { print(glue::glue(&quot;My name is {x$last}, {x$first} {x$last}.&quot;)) invisible(x) } agent007 #&gt; My name is Bond, James Bond. Once the method has been defined, each object of class Person will be printed in that way (unless we specifically ask R to use the default method): (me &lt;- list(first = &quot;Florian&quot;, last = &quot;Privé&quot;)) #&gt; $first #&gt; [1] &quot;Florian&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $last #&gt; [1] &quot;Privé&quot; class(me) &lt;- &quot;Person&quot; me #&gt; My name is Privé, Florian Privé. print.default(me) #&gt; $first #&gt; [1] &quot;Florian&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $last #&gt; [1] &quot;Privé&quot; #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;Person&quot; In most cases, you should not simply remove an attribute from an object, unless you know what you are doing. Otherwise you may end up with very strange results. For example, if you remove the attribute levels from a factor, R will no longer be able to perform simple operations on that factor: (x &lt;- sample(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), 12, replace = TRUE)) #&gt; [1] &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;b&quot; y &lt;- factor(x) attributes(y) #&gt; $levels #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $class #&gt; [1] &quot;factor&quot; attr(y, &quot;levels&quot;) &lt;- NULL y #&gt; Error in as.character.factor(x): malformed factor And if you remove the attribute class, the factor is turned into an atomic vector y &lt;- factor(x) attributes(y) #&gt; $levels #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $class #&gt; [1] &quot;factor&quot; unclass(y) #&gt; [1] 2 2 1 3 1 3 2 1 2 2 3 2 #&gt; attr(,&quot;levels&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; If you remove the only attribute (class) from a date vector, the result is a numeric vector representing the number of days since 1970-01-01 (today &lt;- Sys.Date()) #&gt; [1] &quot;2024-07-30&quot; attributes(today) #&gt; $class #&gt; [1] &quot;Date&quot; unclass(today) #&gt; [1] 19934 Exercise Define a simple function that takes two arguments (first_name and last_name) and that returns an object of class “Person”. 3.3.3 Accessors In the previous section, we have seen how we can adding attributes to vectors in order to obtain other important data structures like matrices, arrays, and data frames. Furthermore, we mentioned that two-dimensional matrices and multi-dimensional arrays are based on atomic vectors, while data frames are obtained from generic vectors/lists. We will now see that the choice of vector type (atomic vs. generic) has an effect on the accessibility of elements. For two-dimensional matrices, multi-dimensional arrays and data frames, elements can be accessed in different ways. Data frames can be subsetted like a one-dimensional structure (where it behaves like a list), or a two-dimensional structure (where it behaves like a matrix). The [ accessor can be used on vectors, matrices, arrays, lists and data frames to extract or replace subsets of the data with the same class. (x &lt;- 1:5) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 x[2:3] #&gt; [1] 2 3 x[2:8] #&gt; [1] 2 3 4 5 NA NA NA (y &lt;- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3)) #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 10 #&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 11 #&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 12 y[4:9] #&gt; [1] 4 5 6 7 8 9 (l &lt;- list(a = 2:3, b = &quot;toto&quot;, c = runif(10))) #&gt; $a #&gt; [1] 2 3 #&gt; #&gt; $b #&gt; [1] &quot;toto&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $c #&gt; [1] 0.664580411 0.917853037 0.131289158 0.880099960 0.713364926 0.481320657 0.558787325 #&gt; [8] 0.003776938 0.255363885 0.991235470 l[2:3] #&gt; $b #&gt; [1] &quot;toto&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $c #&gt; [1] 0.664580411 0.917853037 0.131289158 0.880099960 0.713364926 0.481320657 0.558787325 #&gt; [8] 0.003776938 0.255363885 0.991235470 What does with the same class mean? It means that the class of the resulting subset is the same as the object that was subsetted with [. That means, when you subset a vector with the [ accessor, the subset is a vector as well. When you subset a list with the [ accessor, the result is a list: Even if you only select a single entry of the list. The index object can be numeric, logical, character, or empty: x[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)] #&gt; [1] 2 4 x[c(FALSE, TRUE)] #&gt; [1] 2 4 y[] #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 10 #&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 11 #&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 12 l[c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)] #&gt; $a #&gt; [1] 2 3 #&gt; #&gt; $c #&gt; [1] 0.664580411 0.917853037 0.131289158 0.880099960 0.713364926 0.481320657 0.558787325 #&gt; [8] 0.003776938 0.255363885 0.991235470 l[c(FALSE, TRUE)] #&gt; $b #&gt; [1] &quot;toto&quot; Besides using a single vector to subset matrices, arrays and data frames, you can also specify several indices to [ to obtain two-dimensional subsets. An empty index indicates that all entries in that dimension are selected: y[2:3] #&gt; [1] 2 3 y[2:3, ] #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] 2 5 8 11 #&gt; [2,] 3 6 9 12 y[, 2:3] #&gt; [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] 4 7 #&gt; [2,] 5 8 #&gt; [3,] 6 9 y[2, 3] #&gt; [1] 8 Matrices and arrays can also be indexed via a numeric matrix with one column for each dimension. Each row of the index matrix then selects a single element of the array: two_col_ind &lt;- cbind(c(1, 3, 2), c(1, 4, 2)) y[two_col_ind] #&gt; [1] 1 12 5 The [[ and the $ accessor are both operators to access or replace a single element. However, while [[ can be used on vectors, matrices, arrays, lists and data frames, the $ accessor does only work on lists and data frames. x[[3]] #&gt; [1] 3 l[[2]] #&gt; [1] &quot;toto&quot; l[[&quot;c&quot;]] #&gt; [1] 0.664580411 0.917853037 0.131289158 0.880099960 0.713364926 0.481320657 0.558787325 #&gt; [8] 0.003776938 0.255363885 0.991235470 l$c #&gt; [1] 0.664580411 0.917853037 0.131289158 0.880099960 0.713364926 0.481320657 0.558787325 #&gt; [8] 0.003776938 0.255363885 0.991235470 names(x) &lt;- letters[1:5] x #&gt; a b c d e #&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 x$e #&gt; Error in x$e: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors You can see that for the atomic vector x, x[3] and x[[3]] result in the same output; a vector of length one. But for the list l, the [ accessor returns a list with one entry, while [[ returns a matrix. You can think of a list as a pepper pot, each entry of the list being a sachet of pepper. The [ accessor extracts the desired sachets, but they are still contained within the pot. The [[ accessor takes the desired sachets out of the pot. Figure 3.1: Indexing lists in R. [Source: https://goo.gl/8UkcHq] Besides the fact that the $ accessor cannot be used on atomic vectors, matrices or arrays, the main difference between [[ and $ is that $ does not allow computed indices: l[[2 - 1]] l$(2-1) #&gt; Error: &lt;text&gt;:2:3: unexpected &#39;(&#39; #&gt; 1: l[[2 - 1]] #&gt; 2: l$( #&gt; ^ Before we move on to some exercises, we have two more comments. Per default, the [[ accessor only extracts columns if their column names match one of the strings provided in a character vector exactly. That means, if you want to extract a list entry named aaakv using [[a]], the result will be NULL: names(l) &lt;- c(&quot;aaakv&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) l #&gt; $aaakv #&gt; [1] 2 3 #&gt; #&gt; $b #&gt; [1] &quot;toto&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $c #&gt; [1] 0.664580411 0.917853037 0.131289158 0.880099960 0.713364926 0.481320657 0.558787325 #&gt; [8] 0.003776938 0.255363885 0.991235470 l$a #&gt; [1] 2 3 l[[&quot;a&quot;]] #&gt; NULL To allow for partial matching, use exact = FALSE: l[[&quot;a&quot;, exact = FALSE]] #&gt; [1] 2 3 Per default, the [ accessor coerces the result to the lowest possible dimension. For example, if you extract a single row from a matrix using [, the result will be a vector: y #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 10 #&gt; [2,] 2 5 8 11 #&gt; [3,] 3 6 9 12 y[1, ] #&gt; [1] 1 4 7 10 To change this behavior, set drop = FALSE y[1, , drop = FALSE] #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] 1 4 7 10 Exercises In which order are matrix elements stored? Use the dimension attribute to make a function that computes the sum of every n successive elements of a vector. Ex: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -&gt; expected outcome: 3 7 11 15 19 [Which are the special cases that you should consider?] Convert the following matrix to a vector by using this replacement rule for rows: (0, 0) -&gt; 0 (0, 1) -&gt; 1 (1, 1) -&gt; 2 (1, 0) -&gt; NA mat &lt;- matrix(0, 10, 2) mat[c(5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19)] &lt;- 1 mat #&gt; [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] 0 0 #&gt; [2,] 0 1 #&gt; [3,] 0 0 #&gt; [4,] 0 0 #&gt; [5,] 1 1 #&gt; [6,] 0 1 #&gt; [7,] 0 1 #&gt; [8,] 1 0 #&gt; [9,] 1 1 #&gt; [10,] 0 0 You have to use the following matrix to do so: (decode &lt;- matrix(c(0, NA, 1, 2), 2)) #&gt; [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] 0 1 #&gt; [2,] NA 2 Start by doing it for one row, then by using apply(). Finally, replace it by a special accessor. Expected result: #&gt; [1] 0 1 0 0 2 1 1 NA 2 0 3.4 Environments and scoping The final section of this chapter is about environments and scoping. These concepts may be confusing in the beginning; if you are still puzzled about environments and scoping at the end of this section, don’t get frustrated. We will provide some references to other materials that you can read at the end of this section. Let us dive right into it: Environments associate a set of names with a set of values. You can think of an environment as a list, but with four important exceptions: Every name in an environment is unique. The names in an environment are not ordered. Every environment has a parent environment. Environments have reference semantics. Let us take a closer look at exception 3: Every environment has a parent environment. One environment doesn’t follow that rule: the empty environment. The empty environment is the ultimate ancestor of all other environments. All other environments have parents. Most environments have grandparents (the parent’s parent), and the ancestors of an environment include all parent environments up to the empty environment. When R is looking for a variable, it will start looking for that variable inside the current environment. If R cannot find the variable in the current environment, it will look in the parent environment. If the variable doesn’t exist in the parent environment either, R will look in the parent environment of the parent, and so on. Let us consider an example to make this point clearer. h &lt;- function() { x &lt;- 10 f &lt;- function() { x + 1 } f() } x &lt;- 100 h() #&gt; [1] 11 To evaluate the function h() above, R needs to evaluate the function f(). The function f() simply returns x + 1. But in order to compute x + 1, R needs to find the value associated with the name x. R will start looking in the current environment; the function body of f(): f &lt;- function() { x + 1 } x is not defined in the body of f(), hence R will look for the variable in the parent environment. The parent environment of f() is h() (as f() is defined inside of h()): h &lt;- function() { x &lt;- 10 f &lt;- function() { x + 1 } f() } x is associated with the value 10 in line 2. Therefore, R takes that value to compute x + 1, and h() returns 11. The principle that R will look for a name in the parent environment if it is not found in the current environment is what is called lexical scoping. More precisely: Lexical scoping is the set of rules that determines how R finds the value associated with a name. The lexical in lexical scoping comes from the computer science term lexing, which is the process of breaking down a string into meaningful pieces that the programming language can understand. In short, R’s lexical scoping follows these four primary rules; Dynamic lookup: In R, dynamic lookup focuses on where to look for values, not when to look for them. In other words, R looks for values when the function is run, not when the function is created. For example, defining the following function won’t throw and error; even if x has not been defined yet: fct &lt;- function() { x + 1 } But once we call fct(), R tries to look for x and returns an error, if x does not exist: fct() #&gt; Error in fct(): object &#39;x&#39; not found A fresh start: Every time a function is called, a new environment is created to host its execution. This means that each invocation is completely independent of all prior invocations: fct &lt;- function() { if (!exists(&quot;x&quot;)) x &lt;- 1 else x &lt;- x + 1 x } fct() #&gt; [1] 1 fct() #&gt; [1] 1 You are, however, able to circumvent this using the super assignment &lt;&lt;-. Super assignment never creates a variable in the current environment, but modifies an existing variable found in a parent environment. If the variable is not found in a parent environment, super assignment will create one in the global environment: fct &lt;- function() { if (!exists(&quot;x&quot;)) x &lt;&lt;- 1 else x &lt;&lt;- x + 1 x } fct() #&gt; [1] 1 fct() #&gt; [1] 2 fct() #&gt; [1] 3 Functions versus variables: Whenever a function and a non-function in two different environments share the same name, R ignores non-function objects when looking for that value: f1 &lt;- function(x) x + 10 f2 &lt;- function() { f1 &lt;- 30 f1(f1) } f2() #&gt; [1] 40 Name masking: Name masking is the basic principle of lexical scoping. It controls that names defined inside a function mask names defined outside that function. Name masking is related closely to the third exception Every environment has a parent environment mentioned in connection to environments in the beginning of this section. The four rules defining R’s lexical scoping have some implications that may be confusing at first. As mentioned above, the output of a function may depend on the objects defined outside of the function: fct &lt;- function() { x + 1 } x &lt;- 15 fct() #&gt; [1] 16 x &lt;- 10 fct() #&gt; [1] 11 Conversely, lexical scoping can also lead to a function being independent of the objects outside of the function: fct &lt;- function() { x &lt;- 5 x + 1 } x &lt;- 15 fct() #&gt; [1] 6 We generally want to avoid this behavior, as it can lead to errors and misunderstandings. Furthermore, lexical scoping may lead to erroneous outputs. For example, if you make a spelling mistake in your code and write y instead of z in the body of the function, the output will not be as expected: fct &lt;- function(x, z) { x^y # instead of x^z } x &lt;- 2 y &lt;- 3 z &lt;- x + y fct(x, z) #&gt; [1] 8 Another potential problem to be aware of is that you can accidentally redefine functions without noticing: c &lt;- function(...) paste0(...) c(1, 2, 3) #&gt; [1] &quot;123&quot; The function c() defined above will mask the base R function c() combining values into a vector (R will look for the name c in the current environment first). If this happens, you need to tell R to look for the original function in the package that includes that function in order to use it, i.e.: base::c(1, 2, 3) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 Fortunately, you can easily remove the duplicated function from the current environment with rm(), as R will start looking for the name in the current environment. When calling the function c() afterwards, the name c is no longer defined in the current environment, and R will look for the name in the parent environments: rm(c) c(1, 2, 3) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 If you are still confused about environments and scoping, we recommend you take a look at these other materials: Chapter 6 Functions of Advanced R by Hadley Wickham. Chapter 7 Environments of Advanced R by Hadley Wickham. Chapter 15 Scoping Rules of R of R Programming for Data Science by Roger Peng. This chapter also comes with video versions of Section 15.1 and Section 15.3. 3.5 Summary Real numbers are represented as floating-point numbers, which can lead to floating-point errors. Use all.equal() or dplyr::near() instead of == to test if two objects are equal. ... is a special argument that allows functions to take any number if arguments. ... is greedy and any misspelled or non-existing arguments will be passed on without raising an error. The function sample() can be used with a vector, a single number, or even a real number. Internally, sample() turns any (real) number x into a sequence starting with 1 and increasing with 1 until the upper limit x is reached. The colon operator from:to can be used to generate sequences staring from from and ending with to in steps of 1 or -1 (similar to seq()). All R objects have a type. The four most common types of a basic (atomic) vector are logical, integer, double, and character. Atomic vectors are one-dimensional and homogeneous (i.e. all contents must be of the same type). Generic vectors (or lists) are one-dimensional and heterogeneous (i.e. they can contain different types). Two-dimensional matrices and multi-dimensional arrays are obtained from atomic vectors by adding the attribute dim. Data frames are generic vectors whose contents are equal-length vectors. Per default, data frames have three attributes: names, class, and row.names. R has class-specific functions, called methods. You can define your own attributes using the function structure(). Data frames can be subsetted like a one-dimensional structure (where it behaves like a list), or a two-dimensional structure (where it behaves like a matrix). The [ accessor can be used on vectors, matrices, arrays, lists and data frames to extract or replace subsets of the data with the same class. The [[ accessor can be used on vectors, matrices, arrays, lists and data frames to access or replace a single element. The $ accessor can be used on lists and data frames to access or replace single elements. Environments associate a set of names with a set of values. If a name is not found in the current environment, R will look for the name in the parent environments. Lexical scoping is the set of rules that determines how R finds the value associated with a name, and it can be quite confusing… Useful resources Computer Floating-Point Arithmetic and round-off errors, article by Kausal Kaluarachchi.
