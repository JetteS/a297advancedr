"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Prerequisites 1.2 Content 1.3 Useful resources", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Prerequisites Have at least a basic knowledge of R, Install recent versions of R (&gt;= 3.4) and RStudio (&gt;= 1.2), Install associated package advr38pkg with remotes::install_github(\"privefl/advr38pkg\"); this will install other dependencies that are needed in this book. Install Git and create a GitHub account 1.2 Content It is impossible to become expert in R in only one training course. Yet, this course aims at giving a wide understanding of many aspects of R. Some external resources will be referred to in this book for you to be able to deepen what you would have learned in this course. This course was originally composed of 9 sessions (3 hours each): R programming and good practices (1.5 sessions) Data analysis with the tidyverse (3.5 sessions) R code performance (2 sessions) R packages (1 session) Bonus: Shiny (1 session) 1.3 Useful resources Course on R debugging and robust programming by Laurent Gatto &amp; Robert Stojnic, Data Challenge Lab by Hadley Wickham, Advanced R by Hadley Wickham, and some solutions, R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund &amp; Hadley Wickham, and some solutions, R packages by Hadley Wickham, Efficient R programming by Colin Gillespie &amp; Robin Lovelace, R Programming for Data Science by Roger D. Peng, Mastering Software Development in R by Roger D. Peng, Sean Kross and Brooke Anderson, other resources linked from these materials. "],["good-practices.html", "Chapter 2 Good practices 2.1 Coding style 2.2 RStudio 2.3 Version control (Git) 2.4 Getting help", " Chapter 2 Good practices 2.1 Coding style Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread.  Hadley Wickham Please make your code readable by following e.g. this coding style (examples below come from this guide). You can use package styler (that provides RStudio addins) to correct your style: 2.1.1 Naming Be smart with your naming. I cant tell the number of times Ive seen df &lt;- as.matrix(mtcars) on Stack Overflow. 2.1.2 Spacing Put a space before and after = when naming arguments in function calls. Most infix operators (==, +, -, &lt;-, etc.) are also surrounded by spaces, except those with relatively high precedence: ^, :, ::, and :::. Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English). # Good average &lt;- mean((feet / 12) + inches, na.rm = TRUE) x &lt;- 1:10 base::sum # Bad average&lt;-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE) x &lt;- 1 : 10 base :: sum 2.1.3 Indenting Curly braces, {}, define the most important hierarchy of R code. To make this hierarchy easy to see, always indent the code inside {} by two spaces. This should be automatic in RStudio. # Good if (y &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; debug) { message(&quot;y is negative&quot;) } if (y == 0) { if (x &gt; 0) { log(x) } else { message(&quot;x is negative or zero&quot;) } } else { y ^ x } # Bad if (y &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; debug) message(&quot;Y is negative&quot;) if (y == 0) { if (x &gt; 0) { log(x) } else { message(&quot;x is negative or zero&quot;) } } else { y ^ x } 2.1.4 Long lines Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. If you find yourself running out of room, this is a good indication that you should encapsulate some of the work in a separate function. If a function call is too long to fit on a single line, use one line for the function name, for each argument, and for the closing ). This makes the code easier to read and to modify later. 2.1.5 Other Use &lt;-, not =, for assignment. Keep = for parameters. # Good x &lt;- 5 system.time( x &lt;- rnorm(1e6) ) # Bad x = 5 system.time( x = rnorm(1e6) ) Dont put ; at the end of a line, and avoid multiple commands on the same line. Only use return() for early returns. Otherwise rely on R to return the result of the last evaluated expression. # Good add_two &lt;- function(x, y) { x + y } # Bad add_two &lt;- function(x, y) { return(x + y) } Use \", not ', for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes. # Good &quot;Text&quot; &#39;Text with &quot;quotes&quot;&#39; &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;http://style.tidyverse.org&quot;&gt;A link&lt;/a&gt;&#39; # Bad &#39;Text&#39; &#39;Text with &quot;double&quot; and \\&#39;single\\&#39; quotes&#39; 2.2 RStudio Download a recent version of RStudio (&gt;= 1.2) and use it! Learn more about the new features of RStudio at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/release-notes/. RStudio features: everything you can expect from a good IDE keyboard shortcuts I use Ctrl + Space (auto-completion, better than Tab) Ctrl + Up (command history &amp; search) Ctrl + Click (function source code) Ctrl + Enter (execute line of code) Ctrl + Shift + A (reformat code) Ctrl + Shift + C (comment/uncomment selected lines) Ctrl + Shift + K (knit) Ctrl + Shift + B (build package, website or book) Ctrl + Shift + M (pipe) Alt + Shift + K to see all shortcuts Panels (everything is integrated, including Git and a terminal) Interactive data importation from files and connections (see this webinar) Use code diagnostics: RStudio Projects: Meaningful structure in one folder The working directory automatically switches to the projects folder The File tab displays the associated files and folders in the project History of R commands and open files Any settings associated with the project, such as Git settings, are loaded. Note that you can have a .Rprofile file in the projects root directory to enable project-specific settings to be loaded each time people open the project. Read more at https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/ and also see chapter Efficient set-up of book Efficient R programming. 2.3 Version control (Git) 2.3.1 Why use Git? You dont use Git? Figure 2.1: You dont use Version Control? Have you ever: Made a change to code, realized it was a mistake and wanted to revert back? Lost code or had a backup that was too old? Wanted to submit a change to someone elses code? Wanted to share your code, or let other people work on your code? In these cases, and probably many others, a version control system should make your life easier (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/1408464/6103040). Version control for the researcher: dont do that, use Git Version control for the data analyst: reproducible workflow Also, see https://stackoverflow.com/q/2712421/6103040. Use version control to work from anywhere Working with GitHub can be a line on your CV (read more): A lot of students have said to me later, even first-year undergraduates, that using GitHub has helped them a lot when they went for an internship or a research position interview. They are able to say, Oh, I already have worked with GitHub. Im familiar with it. I know how it works. So I think they are at least able to put that on their CV and go into a situation where theres a research or data analysis team and say, Yeah, sure. I am actually familiar with the same tools that you use.  Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, Duke University, RStudio Be able to get websites for your packages with pkgdown, for your book (like this one!) with bookdown, for your personal webpage with R Markdown Websites or blogdown. 2.3.2 About Git Main Git platforms (share your code, collaborate): GitHub, documentation (only free for public repositories, now owned by Microsoft) GitLab UGA (documentation) or just GitLab (open source &amp; free) Bitbucket (free when you have less than 5 collaborators) any server.. 4 main commands: add: add files to be part of the next commit commit: snapshot of your code at a specified point in time (you can and you should use this even when having no internet connection) push: merge your local modifications with the main project pull: update your local project with the latest version of the main project Simple (solo) use of git to prevent merge conflicts: after opening a project, always pull before closing a project, always commit/push Use git even when you do not have any internet connection! (e.g. on a secure server) Just use commits for version control locally. How to link between an RStudio project and a GitHub repository? For Mac users, you might need to use the terminal for git clone, then create the RStudio project from the existing directory. If you have some permission denied for the public key, you might also need to run ssh-agent -s &amp;&amp; ssh-add &lt;path_to_public_key&gt; (cf. this SO answer). Help with Git: Happy Git and GitHub for the useR Git cheat sheet When things go wrong To fix a mistake Create a new branch with git and manage branches 2.4 Getting help 2.4.1 Help yourself, learn how to debug A basic solution is to print everything, but its usually not working well on complex problems. A convenient solution to see all the variables states in your code is to place some browser() from where you want to check the variables states. To debug functions, debugonce() is also very useful. my_log &lt;- function(x) log(x - 1) my_fun &lt;- function(a, b) { # browser() la &lt;- my_log(a) lb &lt;- my_log(b) la + lb } my_fun(1, 0) #&gt; Warning in log(x - 1): NaNs produced #&gt; [1] NaN Try to uncomment browser() or use debugonce(my_fun): debugonce(my_fun) my_fun(1, 0) Learn more with this book chapter, this other book chapter, this webinar and this RStudio article. 2.4.2 External help Cant remember useful functions? Use cheat sheets. You can search for specific R stuff on https://rseek.org/. You should also read documentations carefully. If youre using a package, search for vignettes and a GitHub repository. You can also use Stack Overflow. The most common use of Stack Overflow is when you have an error or a question, you google it, and most of the times the first links are Q/A on Stack Overflow. You can ask questions on Stack Overflow (using the tag r). You need to make a great R reproducible example if you want your question to be answered. Sometimes, while making this reproducible example, you find the answer to your problem. If youre confident enough with your R skills, you can take the next step and answer questions on Stack Overflow. Its a good way to increase your skills, or just to procrastinate while writing a scientific manuscript. You can also join communities, e.g. join the French-speaking R community or join the R-Ladies community on Slack. These are generally much friendlier and welcoming spaces compared to Stack Overflow.

R looks for values when the function is run, not when its created. This means that the output of a function can be different depending on objects outside its environment: h &lt;- function() { x &lt;- 10 f &lt;- function() { x + 1 } f() } x &lt;- 100 h() #&gt; [1] 11 Variable x is not defined inside f so R will look at the environment of f (where f was defined) and then at the parent environment, and so on. Here, the first x that is found has value 10. Be aware that for functions, packages environments are checked last so that you can redefine functions without noticing. c &lt;- function(...) paste0(...) c(1, 2, 3) #&gt; [1] &quot;123&quot; base::c(1, 2, 3) ## you need to explicit the package #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 rm(c) ## remove the new function from the environment c(1, 2, 3) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 You can use the &lt;&lt;- operator to change the value of an object in an upper environment: count1 &lt;- 0 count2 &lt;- 0 f &lt;- function(i) { count1 &lt;- count1 + 1 ## will assign a new (temporary) count1 count2 &lt;&lt;- count2 + 1 ## will assign count2 on top i + 1 } sapply(1:10, f) #&gt; [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 c(count1, count2) #&gt; [1] 0 10 Finally, how does ... work? Basically, you copy and paste what is put in ...: f1 &lt;- function(...) { list(...) } f1(a = 2, b = 3) #&gt; $a #&gt; [1] 2 #&gt; #&gt; $b #&gt; [1] 3 list(a = 2, b = 3) #&gt; $a #&gt; [1] 2 #&gt; #&gt; $b #&gt; [1] 3 Learn more about functions and scoping rules of R with the R Programming for Data Science book. 3.6 Attributes and classes Attributes are metadata associated with an object. You can get/set the list of attributes with attributes() or one particular attribute with attr(). attributes(iris) #&gt; $names #&gt; [1] &quot;Sepal.Length&quot; &quot;Sepal.Width&quot; &quot;Petal.Length&quot; &quot;Petal.Width&quot; &quot;Species&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $class #&gt; [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $row.names #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 #&gt; [29] 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 #&gt; [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 100 entries ] class(iris) #&gt; [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; attr(iris, &quot;row.names&quot;) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 #&gt; [29] 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 #&gt; [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 100 entries ] You can use structure() to create an object and add some arbitrary attributes. structure(1:10, my_fancy_attribute = &quot;blabla&quot;) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 #&gt; attr(,&quot;my_fancy_attribute&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;blabla&quot; There are also some attributes with specific accessor functions to get and set values. For example, use names(x), dim(x) and class(x) instead of attr(x, \"names\"), attr(x, \"dim\") and attr(x, \"class\"). class(mylm &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = iris)) #&gt; [1] &quot;lm&quot; Ive just fitted a linear model in order to predict the sepal length variable of the iris dataset based on the other variables.

It is true that writing inefficient R code is easy, yet writing efficient R code is also possible when you know what youre doing. In this chapter, you will learn how to write R(cpp) code that is fast. 5.1 Rs memory management See this chapter of Advanced R. 5.2 Early advice 5.2.1 NEVER GROW A VECTOR Example computing the cumulative sums of a vector: x &lt;- rnorm(2e4) # Try also with n = 1e5 system.time({ current_sum &lt;- 0 res &lt;- c() for (x_i in x) { current_sum &lt;- current_sum + x_i res &lt;- c(res, current_sum) } }) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.34 0.00 0.36 Here, at each iteration, you are reallocating a vector (of increasing size). Allocation of memory takes time as well as computations. This makes your code quadratic with the size of x (if you multiply the size of x by 2, you can expect the execution time to be multiplied by 4, for large sample sizes), whereas it should be only linear. A good solution is to always pre-allocate your results (if you know the size): system.time({ current_sum &lt;- 0 res2 &lt;- double(length(x)) for (i in seq_along(x)) { current_sum &lt;- current_sum + x[i] res2[i] &lt;- current_sum } }) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0 0 0 all.equal(res2, res) #&gt; [1] TRUE If you dont know the size of the results, you can store them in a list and merge them afterwards: system.time({ current_sum &lt;- 0 res3 &lt;- list() for (i in seq_along(x)) { current_sum &lt;- current_sum + x[i] res3[[i]] &lt;- current_sum } }) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.01 0.00 0.02 all.equal(unlist(res3), res) #&gt; [1] TRUE With recent versions of R (&gt;= 3.4), you can efficiently grow a vector using system.time({ current_sum &lt;- 0 res4 &lt;- c() for (i in seq_along(x)) { current_sum &lt;- current_sum + x[i] res4[i] &lt;- current_sum } }) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0 0 0 all.equal(res4, res) #&gt; [1] TRUE Assigning to an element of a vector beyond the current length now over-allocates by a small fraction. The new vector is marked internally as growable, and the true length of the new vector is stored in the truelength field. This makes building up a vector result by assigning to the next element beyond the current length more efficient, though pre-allocating is still preferred. The implementation is subject to change and not intended to be used in packages at this time. (NEWS) An even better solution would be to avoid the loop by using a vectorized function: system.time(res5 &lt;- cumsum(x)) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0 0 0 all.equal(res5, res) #&gt; [1] TRUE x &lt;- rnorm(1e7) system.time(cumsum(x)) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.07 0.00 0.08 As a second example, let us generate a matrix of uniform values (max changing for every column): n &lt;- 1e3 max &lt;- 1:1000 system.time({ mat &lt;- NULL for (m in max) { mat &lt;- cbind(mat, runif(n, max = m)) } }) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.68 0.25 0.93 apply(mat, 2, max)[1:10] #&gt; [1] 0.9993176 1.9978583 2.9984693 3.9938841 4.9983148 5.9858956 6.9821112 7.9890868 #&gt; [9] 8.9979548 9.9855184 Instead, we should pre-allocate a matrix of the right size: system.time({ mat3 &lt;- matrix(0, n, length(max)) for (i in seq_along(max)) { mat3[, i] &lt;- runif(n, max = max[i]) } }) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.03 0.00 0.03 apply(mat3, 2, max)[1:10] #&gt; [1] 0.9997787 1.9973298 2.9993526 3.9993448 4.9987355 5.9698328 6.9996362 7.9937679 #&gt; [9] 8.9921025 9.9853226 Or we could use a list instead. What is nice with using a list is that you dont need to pre-allocate. Indeed, as opposed to atomic vectors, each element of a list is in different places in memory so that you dont have to reallocate all the data when you add an element to a list. system.time({ l &lt;- list() for (i in seq_along(max)) { l[[i]] &lt;- runif(n, max = max[i]) } mat4 &lt;- do.call(&quot;cbind&quot;, l) }) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.03 0.00 0.03 apply(mat4, 2, max)[1:10] #&gt; [1] 0.9997254 1.9994541 2.9971021 3.9954524 4.9966709 5.9925307 6.9873768 7.9972408 #&gt; [9] 8.9937728 9.9957201 Instead of pre-allocating yourself, you can use sapply (or lapply and calling do.call() after, as previously done): system.time( mat4 &lt;- sapply(max, function(m) runif(n, max = m)) ) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.03 0.00 0.04 apply(mat4, 2, max)[1:10] #&gt; [1] 0.997627 1.998317 2.992739 3.996852 4.995323 5.983786 6.998429 7.997255 8.999862 #&gt; [10] 9.984761 Dont listen to people telling you that sapply() is a vectorized operation that is so much faster than loops. You can learn more with this blog post. 5.2.2 Use the right function Often, in order to optimize your code, you can simply find the right function to do what you need to do. For example, rowMeans(x) is much faster than apply(x, 1, mean). Similarly, if you want more efficient functions that apply to rows and columns of matrices, you can check package {matrixStats}. Another example is when reading large text files; in such cases, prefer using data.table::fread() rather than read.table(). Generally, packages that uses C/Rcpp are efficient. 5.2.3 Do not try to optimize everything Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.  Donald Knuth. If you try to optimize each and every part of your code, you will end up losing a lot of time writing it, and it will probably make your code less readable. R is great at prototyping quickly because you can write code in a concise and easy way. Start by doing just that. If performance matters, then profile your code to see which part of your code is taking too much time and optimize only this part! Learn more on how to profile your code in RStudio in this article. 5.3 Vectorization See this great blog post by Noam Ross to understand vectorization. 5.3.1 Exercise Monte-Carlo integration (example from book Efficient R programming) Suppose we wish to estimate the integral \\(\\int_0^1 x^2 dx\\) using a Monte-Carlo method. Essentially, we throw darts at the curve and count the number of darts that fall below the curve (as in the following figure). Monte Carlo Integration pseudo-code Initialize: hits = 0 for i in 1:N \\(~~\\) Generate two random numbers, \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\), between 0 and 1 \\(~~\\) If \\(U_2 &lt; U_1^2\\), then hits = hits + 1 end for Area estimate = hits / N Naively implementing this Monte-Carlo algorithm in R would typically lead to something like: monte_carlo &lt;- function(N) { hits &lt;- 0 for (i in seq_len(N)) { u1 &lt;- runif(1) u2 &lt;- runif(1) if (u1 ^ 2 &gt; u2) { hits &lt;- hits + 1 } } hits / N } This takes a few seconds for N = 1e6: N &lt;- 1e6 system.time(monte_carlo(N)) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 2.53 0.00 2.56 Your task: find a vectorized solution for this problem: system.time(monte_carlo_vec(N)) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.06 0.00 0.07 5.4 Rcpp See this presentation.

Also using A %*% (B %*% y) and solve(A, y) will be faster than A %*% B %*% y and solve(A) %*% y. Dont re-implement linear algebra operations (such as matrix products) yourself. There exist some highly optimized libraries for this. If you want to use linear algebra in Rcpp, try RcppArmadillo or RcppEigen. If you want to use some optimized multi-threaded linear library, you can try Microsoft R Open. 5.5.1 Exercises Compute the Euclidean distances between each of row of X and each row of Y: set.seed(1) X &lt;- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 5) Y &lt;- matrix(rnorm(5000), ncol = 5) A naive implementation would be: system.time({ dist &lt;- matrix(NA_real_, nrow(X), nrow(Y)) for (i in seq_len(nrow(X))) { for (j in seq_len(nrow(Y))) { dist[i, j] &lt;- sqrt(sum((X[i, ] - Y[j, ])^2)) } } }) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.20 0.00 0.21 Hint: \\(\\text{dist}(X_i, Y_j)^2 = (X_i - Y_j)^T (X_i - Y_j) = X_i^T X_i + Y_j^T Y_j - 2 X_i^T Y_j\\).

Is your algorithm doing some redundant computations making it e.g. quadratic instead of linear with respect to the dimension of your data? See exercises (section 5.7) for some insights. You can also find a detailed example in this blog post. 5.7 Exercises Generate \\(10^7\\) (start with \\(10^4\\)) steps of the process described by the formula:\\[X(0)=0\\]\\[X(t+1)=X(t)+Y(t)\\] where \\(Y(t)\\) are independent random variables with the distribution \\(N(0,1)\\). Then, calculate in what percentage of indices \\(t\\) the value of \\(X(t)\\) was negative. You dont need to store values of \\(X\\) if you dont want to.

We can call this package {minidplyr}. After having read the following two sections (6.3 and 6.4), create a first function that helps you select variables of a data frame by using a character vector of variable names or an integer vector of variable positions. Which accessor could you use? Document this function and use it. Bonus (for later): can you use base R function subset to use variables names without quoting them? Check your package with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E and fix all problems. At this point, there should be no ERROR or WARNING, unless you did not document the previous function properly. However, you should still update the DESCRIPTION file with proper information. Do it, fix any problem, and run checks again.

Learn how to make a website out of your package in section 6.5.3 and build one for this package (or another of your packages). Implement more functions if you find this project interesting. For example, make a function mutate2 with the help of base R function transform (or within). Try to make the previous functions more general by taking many arguments at once (in ...). Make sure to keep your existing code as internal functions in order to break your code in manageable parts. 6.3 Quick start In my first package, I just put some functions I used again and again in my work. To quickly start your package, just follow these steps: Create a new RStudio project (not a package). Here, I advise you to create a new project on GitHub (with a README) and then clone it as an RStudio project. It is a good practice to put all your (public) stuff on GitHub (as we learned in section 2.3). Run the following lines of R code. usethis::use_description(list(License = &quot;GPL-3&quot;)) usethis::use_namespace() dir.create(&quot;R&quot;) usethis::use_package_doc() usethis::use_roxygen_md() Restart RStudio and change the following options. You should see a new Build panel next to the Git panel. Then use Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B to build and reload your package. Create a simple function and put it in an .R file in the R/ directory. Inside the function, use Code -&gt; Insert Roxygen Skeleton. Build and reload your package and check the documentation of your new function and that you can use it. 6.4 Basic stuff 6.4.1 DESCRIPTION file See this chapter on the DESCRIPTION file. 6.4.2 R code Put your R code in the R/ directory. Basically it would be mostly functions. Dont use random lines of code like in R scripts. Never explicitly load a package with library() or require(). Use usethis::use_package() to add one package to your DESCRIPTION file. Then, refer to some function with &lt;package&gt;::&lt;function&gt;() in your code, or by using the @import &lt;package&gt; or @import &lt;package&gt; &lt;function&gt; roxygen tags. If one R function need another function in another R file, use the @import &lt;basename&gt;.R to make sure it is built and documented before; it is for example useful if you define new generics and methods in different files. If you modify global options() or graphics par() in a function of your package (try to avoid it), save the old values and reset when you are done: old &lt;- options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) on.exit(options(old), add = TRUE) 6.4.3 Documentation Documentation is super useful for other people (including future-you, in 6 months when you wont remember what you implemented in your package). Make sure to document your code as soon as you write it, otherwise you will never do it. Forget about the man/ (manual) directory, files in this directory will be automatically generated thanks to the roxygen comments you use on top of your R functions. Learn more with this chapter. Note that you can now use the Markdown syntax in the documentation. For example, instead of having to use \\code{foo}, you can directly use `foo` in the roxygen comments. To use (and export) functions already implemented in other packages, for example the pipe from package {magrittr}, you can use usethis::use_package(\"magrittr\") and put the following code somewhere in an R file of your package. #&#39; @importFrom magrittr %&gt;% #&#39; @export magrittr::`%&gt;%` Fun: [How to] Include a dancing banana in your R package documentation. 6.4.4 NAMESPACE file You can also forget about this for now because it should be automatically generated by {roxygen}. If you want to understand whats going on, read this chapter. 6.5 Good practices 6.5.1 Testing You are probably already testing your code, youre only doing it informally. The problem with this approach is that when you come back to this code in 3 months time to add a new feature, youve probably forgotten some of the informal tests you ran the first time around. This makes it very easy to break existing code that used to work (which you should avoid as much as you can). A very good practice is to use unit tests. Read this chapter. To make your first unit tests, use usethis::use_test() while having open the R file you want to test. Write some unit tests, then you can run tests of your package with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T. 6.5.2 Continuous checking I would rarely trust a package that doesnt use these continuous integration services. Its good practice to check your package regularly and on different Operating Systems (OS). Learn more about the different checks there. An easy way to regularly check your package on GitHub is to use GitHub Actions. Indeed, each time you push to your GitHub repository, checks are run on different OS. To use this service, you can run usethis::use_github_action_check_standard(). To get the coverage of your tests, use Codecov by running usethis::use_coverage() and usethis::use_github_action(\"test-coverage\"). Finally, to prevent typos in your package and especially for non-native English speakers, it can be useful to check the spelling in your package. If you think that the word programmation exists and that prefered has only one r at the end (I did!), you should definitely use package {spelling}. Just run spelling::spell_check_setup(); this will check spelling in your package at the end of checks. If it reports words you want to ignore, just put these words in a text file inst/WORDLIST (with one word by line). 6.5.3 Pkgdown Run usethis::use_pkgdown(). If added, remove docs from the .gitignore file. Run pkgdown:::build_site(). On GitHub, go to the settings of your repo, and enable GitHub Pages from the /docs folder. Push the new files. This will render everything that you have in this folder as a website (after 0-2 minutes). To get more information and especially to configure the website, see the documentation, as a {pkgdown} website, of course. For an example, see the website of my package {bigstatsr} and the corresponding YAML file. If you want to make a personal website, check this quick tutorial. 6.6 More 6.6.1 Rcpp We learned about Rcpp in section 5.4. To use Rcpp code in your package, just use usethis::use_rcpp() and put the 2 roxygen tags e.g. in the file R/&lt;package&gt;-package.R. Then, create .cpp files with RStudio and save them the src/ directory. Note that the // [[Rcpp::export]] makes the C++ function available to R, it doesnt export the function as part of your package (though you could access it with &lt;package&gt;:::&lt;rcpp-fun&gt;()). If you want your package to explicitly provides an Rcpp function (as an R function), you also need roxygen comments (beginning with //' instead of #', including //' @export) on top of your Rcpp function. If you need some C++ code from another package (e.g. from package {RcppArmadillo}), normally you would use // [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]] #include &lt;RcppArmadillo.h&gt; In an R package, you dont need the first line but instead you need to add the package to the LinkingTo field of the DESCRIPTION file (e.g. with usethis::use_package(\"RcppArmadillo\", \"LinkingTo\")). 6.6.2 Ignore files There are two types of ignore: Files ignored by Git, specified in the .gitignore file. For example, you dont want to track changes for some large data files or some binaries often changing. You can ignore files by using usethis::use_git_ignore(). Files ignored during the build of your package, specified in the .Rbuildignore file. For example, in my packages, I generally have two directories called tmp-tests and tmp-save where I just put some random code that I used once during development. Checks will tell you if your package contains non-standard files or directories. Moreover, I generally ignore vignettes; they are still built as part of the {pkgdown} website. There is also a {usethis} function for this: usethis::use_build_ignore(). 6.6.3 The inst/ directory When a package is installed, everything in inst/ is copied into the top-level package directory. For example, you can have: inst/extdata/: additional external data for examples and vignettes. See section 6.6.4 for more detail. You can also use inst/testdata/ for data you need in tests. To access one file in this directory, use system.file(). For example, if you have a file inst/extdata/mydata.csv in your package, an user can find it using system.file(\"extdata\", \"mydata.csv\", package = \"&lt;package&gt;\"). inst/include: some C++ code that others can use by LinkingTo your package. For example, when you use #include &lt;Rcpp.h&gt; at the top of your Rcpp code, youre using the code in there. inst/CITATION: how to cite the package.

A weekly data project from the R4DS community. The aim is to understand how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. Safe and supportive space for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions. How it works: The dataset comes from a source article and it is made available on Mondays. People then play with the data set using the tidyverse, explore things that they think are interesting, and/or try to recreate the source article plots/results. And share their own version on Twitter (with the hashtag #TidyTuesday). 8.2 Tidy Thursday Our own mini-version of Tidy Tuesday! Join in teams of 2 (or 3). Choose a dataset from the ones provided. Come up with an interesting topic to visualize (or recreate an existing one). Apply things you have learned in this course, and try to learn new things with our help and Googles help. Share the resulting plot(s) and the code with the rest on Friday with a short presentation talking about challenges and conclusions from the plot. 8.2.1 Choose a dataset Install the {tidytuesdayR} package: install.packages(&quot;tidytuesdayR&quot;) Some interesting datasets: Olympic medals data &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(&#39;2021-07-27&#39;)[[&quot;olympics&quot;]] Netflix titles data &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(&#39;2021-04-20&#39;)[[&quot;netflix_titles&quot;]] Spotify songs data &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(&#39;2020-01-21&#39;)[[&quot;spotify_songs&quot;]] If you do not like any of these, you can also choose from all the previous tidy Tuesday datasets here. 8.2.2 Visualize the data Come up with a question, or an interesting thing to learn from the data. You can get inspired by looking at other participants on Twitter: Shiny app with a compilation of tweets ordered by likes TidyTuesdayRocks Search for #TidyTuesday + dataset_name on Twitter.
