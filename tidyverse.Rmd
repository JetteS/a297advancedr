# Data analysis with the tidyverse

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("knitr-options.R")
source("spelling-check.R")
```

The tidyverse is an opinionated [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 

For learning how to do data analysis from importing data and tidying it to analyzing it and reporting results, we will use [book R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [this course](https://dcl-2017-04.github.io/curriculum/upcoming.html) which are respectively licensed under the [Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/) and the [Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) licenses.

<!-- ## Import data -->

<!-- We have seen the "Import Dataset" button of RStudio: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("images/data-import-environment.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- - You can use [package **readr**](http://readr.tidyverse.org/) (part of the tidyverse). -->

<!-- - Personally, I also really like `data.table::read()` (with parameter `data.table = FALSE` if you want a `data.frame` instead of a `data.table`) which is very fast and convenient, and have been available for quite some time. -->

<!-- - Use [package **feather**](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/03/29/feather/) to read/write data frames from/to R/Python. -->

<!-- - Check other available package with [this list](https://github.com/rstudio/RStartHere#import). -->

<!-- ## Tidy data -->

<!-- So, what does "tidy" mean in "tidyverse"? -->


<!-- ## Other "tidy" packages -->

<!-- - analysis of text data: [package **tidytext**](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) with [the associated book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), -->

<!-- - analysis of financial data: [package **tidyquant**](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/index.html), -->

<!-- - analysis of time series data: [package **tidytime**]. -->
