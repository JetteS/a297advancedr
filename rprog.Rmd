## Common mistakes

> If you are using R and you think you're in hell, [this is a map](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf) for you.

### Equality

```{r}
x <- sqrt(2)
(y <- x^2)
y == 2
print(y, digits = 20)
all.equal(y, 2)  ## equality with some tolerance
all.equal(y, 3)
isTRUE(all.equal(y, 3))  ## if you want a boolean, use isTRUE()
```

### Arguments

```{r}
min(-1, 5, 118)
max(-1, 5, 118)
args(max)
mean(-1, 5, 118)
args(mean)
median(-1, 5, 118)
args(median)
```

Always use one vector if you're not sure:

```{r}
min(c(-1, 5, 118))
max(c(-1, 5, 118))
mean(c(-1, 5, 118))
median(c(-1, 5, 118))
```

### Others

```{r}
sample(1:10)
sample(10)
sample(10.1)
```

```{r}
1:0
seq_len(0)  ## prefer using seq_len (e.g. in for-loops)
n <- 10
1:n+1  # is (1:n) + 1, so 2:(n + 1)
1:(n+1)
seq_len(n + 1)
```


## R base objects

### Types

There are many "atomic" types of data: `logical`, `integer`, `double` and `character` (in this order, see below). There are also `raw` and `complex` but they are rarely used.

You can't mix types in an atomic vector (you can in a list). Coercion will automatically occur if you mix types:

```{r}
(a <- FALSE)
typeof(a)

(b <- 1:10)
typeof(b)
c(a, b)  ## FALSE is coerced to integer 0

(c <- 10.5)
typeof(c)
(d <- c(b, c))  ## coerced to numeric

c(d, "a")  ## coerced to character

c(list(1), "a")

50 < "7"
```

### Exercise

Use the automatic type coercion to convert this boolean matrix to a numeric one (with 0s and 1s). [What do you need to change to get an integer matrix instead?]

```{r}
(mat <- matrix(sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 12, replace = TRUE), 3))
```

## Base objects and accessors

### Objects

- "atomic" vector: vector of same type (see above).

- scalar: this doesn't exist, there are only vector of length 1.

- matrices/arrays: just an atomic vector with some dimensions (attribute).

```{r}
(vec <- 1:12)
dim(vec) <- c(3, 4)
vec
class(vec)
dim(vec) <- c(3, 2, 2)
vec
class(vec)
```

- list: vector of elements with possible different types in it. 

- data.frame: a list whose elements have the same lengths, and formatted somewhat as a matrix.

### Accessors

1. The `[` accessor is used to access a subset of the data **with the same class**.

```{r}
(x <- runif(5))
x[2:3]
x[2:8]
(y <- matrix(runif(12), 3))
y[4:9]  ## a matrix is a vector
(l <- list(a = 2:3, b = "toto", c = runif(10)))
l[2:3]
head(iris)
head(iris[3:4])
class(iris[5])
```

You can also use a logical and character vectors to index these objects. 

```{r}
(x <- runif(4))
x[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
x[c(FALSE, TRUE)]  ## the logical vector is recycled
head(iris[c("Petal.Length", "Species")])
```

2. The `[[` accessor is used to access **a single element**.

```{r}
(x <- 1:10)
x[[3]]
l[[2]]
iris[["Species"]]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Indexing lists in R. [Source: https://goo.gl/8UkcHq]"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQ5en8XWAAICIaJ.jpg")
```

3. Beware partial matching

```{r}
x <- list(aardvark = 1:5)
x$a
x[["a"]]
x[["a", exact = FALSE]]
```

4. Special use of the `[` accessor for array-like data.

```{r}
(mat <- matrix(1:12, 3))
mat[1, ]
mat[, 1:2]
mat[1, 1:2]
mat[1, 1:2, drop = FALSE]
mat[cbind(1, 1:2)]
mat[,]
mat[]
mat[] <- 2
mat
```

Just add a comma for every new dimension.

### Exercises

1. Use the dimension attribute to make a function that computes the sums every n elements of a vector. In which order are matrix elements stored? [Which are the special cases that you should consider?]

```{r}
advr38pkg::sum_every(1:10, 2)
```

2. Compute the means of every numeric columns of the `iris` dataset. Expected result:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colMeans(iris[sapply(iris, is.numeric)])
```

3. Convert this matrix to a vector by replacing `c(0,0,1) <-> 0; c(0,1,0) <-> 1; c(0,0,1) <-> 2; other <-> NA` (use a 3x3x3 array code).

```{r}
mat <- matrix(0, 10, 3); mat[c(1, 5, 8, 12, 16, 17, 19, 23, 24, 29)] <- 1; mat
```

Expected result:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decode <- array(dim = c(3, 3, 3))
decode[2, 1, 1] <- 0
decode[1, 2, 1] <- 1
decode[1, 1, 2] <- 2
decode[mat + 1]
```


## Useful R base functions

In this section, I mention some useful R base functions (also see [this comprehensive list in French](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Kauffmann_aide_memoire_R.pdf) and [this one in English](https://github.com/peterhurford/adv-r-book-solutions/blob/master/03_vocab/functions.r)):

### General

```{r}
# To get some help
?topic

# Run code from the example section
example(sum)
```

```{r}
# Structure overview
str(iris)

# List objects of environment
a <- 1:4; b <- list()
ls()

# Remove objects from the environment
rm(list = ls())  ## remove everything
```

```{r}
# list of available S3 methods
methods(summary)
methods(class = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Call a function with arguments as a list
(l <- lapply(1:5, function(i) i))
do.call('c', l)
```


### Sequence and vector operations

```{r}
1:10  ## integers
seq(1, 10, by = 2)
seq(1, 100, length.out = 10)
seq_len(5)
seq_along(5:8)
rep(1:4, 2)
rep(1:4, each = 2)
rep(1:4, 4:1)
rep_len(1:3, 7)
replicate(5, rnorm(10))
```

```{r}
sort(c(1, 6, 8, 2, 2))
order(c(1, 6, 8, 2, 2), c(0, 0, 0, 2, 1))
sort(c("a1", "a2", "a10"))
gtools::mixedsort(c("a1", "a2", "a10"))  # not in base, obviously
which.max(c(1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 0))
which.min(c(1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 0))
unique(c(1, NA, 2, 3, 2, NA, 3))
table(rep(1:4, 4:1))
table(A = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2), B = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1))
sample(10)
sample(1:10, 5)
sample(1:10, 50, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
round(x <- runif(10, max = 100))
round(x, digits = 2)
round(x, -1)
pmin(1:4, 4:1)
pmax(1:4, 4:1)
outer(1:4, 1:3, '+')
expand.grid(param1 = c(5, 50), param2 = c(1, 3, 10))
```

Also see [this nice Q/A on grouping functions and the *apply family](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3505701/grouping-functions-tapply-by-aggregate-and-the-apply-family) and [this book chapter about looping](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/loop-functions.html).

### Character operations

```{r}
paste("I", "am", "me")
paste0("test", 0)
paste0("PC", 1:10)
me <- "Florian"
glue::glue("I am {me}")  ## not in base, but SO useful
(x <- list.files(pattern = "\\.Rmd$"))
sub("\\.Rmd$", ".pdf", x)
(y <- sample(letters[1:4], 10, replace = TRUE))
match(y, letters[1:4])
y %in% letters[1:2]
rle(rep(1:4, 4:1))
split(1:12, rep(letters[1:3], 4))
intersect(letters[1:4], letters[3:5])
union(letters[1:4], letters[3:5])
setdiff(letters[1:4], letters[3:5])
```

### Logical operators

```{r}
tryCatch(TRUE | stop("will go there"), error = function(e) print(e))
TRUE || stop("won't go there")
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) & c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) 
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) && c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)  ## no warning!!
```

```{r}
(x <- rnorm(10))
ifelse(x > 0, x, -x)
```

Beware with `ifelse()` (learn more [there](https://privefl.github.io/blog/On-the-ifelse-function/)), for example 

```{r}
ifelse(FALSE, 0, 1:5)
`if`(FALSE, 0, 1:5)
```

### Exercises

1. Use `sample()`, `rep_len()` and `split()` to make a function that randomly splits some indices in a list of `K` groups of indices. [Which are the special cases that you should consider?]

```{r}
advr38pkg::split_ind(1:40, 3)
```

2. Use `match()` and some accessor to add a column "my_val" to this data `my_mtcars` by putting the corresponding value of the column specified in "my_col". [Can your solution be used for any number of column names?]

```{r}
my_mtcars <- mtcars[c("mpg", "hp")]
my_mtcars$my_col <- sample(c("mpg", "hp"), size = nrow(my_mtcars), 
                           replace = TRUE)
```

Expected result:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ind <- cbind(seq_len(nrow(my_mtcars)), 
             match(my_mtcars[["my_col"]], names(my_mtcars)))
my_mtcars$my_val <- my_mtcars[ind]
head(my_mtcars)
```

3. In the following data frame, for the first 3 columns, replace letters by corresponding numbers based on the `code`:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  id1 = c("a", "f", "a"),
  id2 = c("b", "e", "e"), 
  id3 = c("c", "d", "f"),
  inter = c(7.343, 2.454, 3.234),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
df
(code <- setNames(1:6, letters[1:6]))
```

Expected result:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df[-4] <- lapply(df[-4], function(col) code[col])
df
```


## Environments and scoping

Lexical scoping determines where to look for values, not when to look for them. R looks for values when the function is run, not when itâ€™s created. This means that the output of a function can be different depending on objects outside its environment:

```{r}
h <- function() {
  x <- 10
  g <- function() {
    f <- function() {
      x + 1
    }
    print(environment(f))
    print(ls(environment(f)))  ## list the objects in the environment
    print(parent.env(environment(f)))  ## environment(g)
    f()
  }
  print(environment(g))
  print(ls(environment(g)))
  print(parent.env(environment(g)))
  g()
}
x <- 100
h()
```

Variable `x` is not defined inside `f` so R will look at the environment of `f` (where `f` was defined) and then at the parent environment, and so on. Here, the first `x` that is found has value `10`.

Be aware that for functions, packages environments are checked last so that you can redefine them without noticing.

```{r}
c <- function(...) paste0(...)
c(1, 2, 3)
base::c(1, 2, 3)  ## you need to explicit the package
rm(c)  ## remove the new function from the environment
c(1, 2, 3)
```

You can use the `<<-` operator to change the value of an object in an upper environment:

```{r}
count1 <- 0
count2 <- 0
f <- function(i) {
  count1 <-  count1 + 1  ## will assign a new (temporary) count1
  count2 <<- count2 + 1  ## will assign count2 on top
  i + 1
}
sapply(1:10, f)
count1
count2
```

Finally, how works the `...`? Basically, you copy and paste what is put in `...`:

```{r}
f1 <- function(...) {
  list(...)
}
f1(a = 2, b = 3)
list(a = 2, b = 3)
```

Learn more about [functions](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/functions.html) and [scoping rules of R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/scoping-rules-of-r.html) with the [R Programming for Data Science book](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/).

## Attributes and classes

Attributes are metadata associated with an object. You can get/set the list of attributes with `attributes()` or one particular attribute with `attr()`.

```{r}
attributes(iris)
class(iris)
attr(iris, "row.names")
```

You can use `structure()` to create an object and add some arbitrary attributes.

```{r}
structure(1:10, my_fancy_attribute = "blabla")
```

There are also some attributes with some specific accessor functions to get and set values. For example, use `names(x)`, `dim(x)` and `class(x)` instead of `attr(x, "names")`, `attr(x, "dim")` and `attr(x, "class")`. You can also put comments in an object with `comment()`.

***

```{r}
class(mylm <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = iris))
```

I've just fitted a linear model in order to predict the sepal length variable of the `iris` dataset based on the other variables. Using `lm()` gets me an object of class `lm`. What are the methods I can use for this object?

```{r}
methods(class = class(mylm))
summary(mylm)
plot(mylm)
```

***

R has the easiest way to create a class and to use methods on them and it's called S3. If you want to know more about the other types of classes, see the [Advanced R book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

```{r}
agent007 <- list(first = "James", last = "Bond")
agent007
```

```{r}
class(agent007) <- "Person"
# Just make a function called <method_name>.<class_name>()
print.Person <- function(x) {
  print(glue::glue("My name is {x$last}, {x$first} {x$last}."))
}

agent007
```

```{r}
# Constructor as simple function
Person <- function(first, last) {
  structure(list(first = first, last = last), class = "Person")
}
(me <- Person("Florian", "PrivÃ©"))
```

An object can have many classes:

```{r}
Worker <- function(first, last, job) {
    obj <- Person(first, last)
    obj$job <- job
    class(obj) <- c("Worker", class(obj))
    obj
}
print.Worker <- function(x) {
    print.Person(x) 
    print(glue::glue("I am a {x$job}."))
}

(worker_007 <- Worker("James", "Bond", "secret agent"))
(worker_me <- Worker("Florian", "PrivÃ©", "PhD student"))
```
