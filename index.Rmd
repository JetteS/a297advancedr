This document is a modification of the book [advr38book](https://privefl.github.io/advr38book/index.html) by Florian Privé. Florian originally developed the materials for the doctoral school of Grenoble, France, but now they are used as the main course material for the PhD course **Advanced R** offered by the Graduate School of Health, Aarhus University, Denmark.
The main aim of this book is to give the reader a greater understanding of the `R` language, and to enable them to produce more clean, sophisticated and efficient `R` code. The reader will learn about packages and tools to simplify their coding life, about data analysis and visualization, and about best practices when coding in `R`.
After studying these materials, the reader should be able to

* use RStudio with a better setup to be more efficient
* use Git as a version control system to track file changes
* understand how to write better and simpler code in `R`
* manipulate and visualize data with the tidyverse and R Markdown
* produce efficient `R` code
* develop an `R` package.


## How to read this book {.unnumbered}

Readers are recommended to have a basic understanding of `R` and some experience writing `R` code. You should, for example, be able to create variables, define functions, implement loops and subset objects such as vectors and data frames. 
If you are new to `R`, you can take a look at Garrett Grolemund's [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) (2014), a book that uses hands-on examples to teach you how to program in `R`. Some other useful resources are

* [Basic Basics](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-0/), a lesson unit from [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/) providing an opinionated tour of RStudio for new users and a step-by-step guide to installing and using `R` packages.
* [A Gentle Introduction to Tidy Statistics in R](https://posit.co/resources/videos/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/) (Thomas Mock, 2019), a one-hour free video webinar about how to get started quickly with basics of research statistics in `R`.
* [Posit Recipes](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes), a collection of `R` code snippets and instructions featuring up-to-date best practices for coding in `R`.
* [The RStudio Essentials Series](https://www.rstudio.com/tags/essentials/), a webinar series about how to program and manage `R` projects using RStudio's tools. These videos will also help you learn good development practices. 

Finally, posit also provides some very useful [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/), for example about the [RStudio IDE](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rstudio-ide.html), that you may find helpful.

In total, this book consists of eight chapters. The first chapter is a short introduction covering prerequisites, content and other useful resources. The following six chapters are theoretical and cover the following topics

* Good practices
* Advanced `R` programming
* R Markdown
* Data analysis with the tidyverse
* Code performance
* How to make an `R` package

The final chapter is an opportunity for the reader to apply the new theory using real data from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md).

The reader does not need to read through the materials from beginning to end. I have tried to make each chapter as self-contained as possible, and the reader should be able to only read the parts that are most interesting or relevant.
